WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.737
Okay, we've got
power to the laser.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.839
I should've brought
an umbrella.

00:07.211 --> 00:08.511
What for?
It's not going to rain.

00:08.512 --> 00:11.047
I know that, but with
skin as fair as mine,

00:11.048 --> 00:14.450
moon burn is a
real possibility.

00:14.451 --> 00:16.151
That's a "bazinga," right?

00:16.152 --> 00:18.820
One of my best,
don't you think?

00:21.796 --> 00:23.202
Howard, do you want
to double-check

00:23.203 --> 00:24.500
the equatorial mount
on the laser?

00:24.501 --> 00:26.488
We need it locked onto
the Sea of Tranquility.

00:26.489 --> 00:27.914
You got it.

00:27.915 --> 00:30.061
Oh, Raj, no.

00:30.062 --> 00:33.158
Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet

00:33.159 --> 00:35.164
and filling it
with pictures of naked women,

00:35.165 --> 00:37.951
so we don't have
to peep through windows.

00:37.952 --> 00:39.301
It's not like that.

00:39.302 --> 00:40.417
I'm watching someone's TV.

00:40.418 --> 00:42.013
<i>The Good Wife</i> is on.

00:43.776 --> 00:48.195
I tell you, this is
my new <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

00:48.196 --> 00:49.140
Leonard, Leonard.

00:49.141 --> 00:50.285
What is that?
What is that?

00:50.286 --> 00:53.586
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.817
How on earth
can you say

00:55.818 --> 00:58.473
"dirty sock" and "relax"
in the same sentence?

00:58.474 --> 01:02.951
Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty discarded socks.

01:02.952 --> 01:05.163
Not my world.

01:06.832 --> 01:10.035
Hey, you know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

01:10.036 --> 01:13.591
I wasn't aware that
lunar ranging was her thing.

01:13.592 --> 01:16.580
Although, I suppose the
retro-reflector left on the moon

01:16.581 --> 01:20.307
by Neil Armstrong
does qualify as a shiny object.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.860
Why don't you
ask her to come up?

01:22.861 --> 01:23.761
I don't know, it's still

01:23.762 --> 01:25.140
a little weird
since, you know...

01:25.141 --> 01:26.780
She dumped you?
She didn't dump me.

01:26.781 --> 01:29.798
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.544
I fail to see how a relationship

01:31.545 --> 01:35.000
can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

01:35.001 --> 01:35.939
Oh, it's very simple.

01:35.940 --> 01:37.512
Leonard was living
in a little town

01:37.513 --> 01:39.156
called "Please don't leave me"

01:39.157 --> 01:43.311
while Penny had just moved
to the island of "Buh-bye."

01:45.790 --> 01:46.966
Screw you guys.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.472
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

01:48.473 --> 01:50.183
If it's not
too much trouble,

01:50.184 --> 01:52.158
I'd like to point this
at the moon now.

01:52.159 --> 01:53.195
Wait a second.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.072
The good wife is crying.

01:56.111 --> 01:57.849

02:27.025 --> 02:28.325
Oh, hi.
What's going on?

02:28.392 --> 02:31.194
We're up on the roof bouncing
laser beams off the moon.

02:31.195 --> 02:33.296
I'm sorry, what?

02:33.297 --> 02:34.697
It's pretty cool.

02:34.698 --> 02:36.165
We've got a two-meter parabolic
reflector and everything.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.699
I thought you might
want to see it.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.800
That makes no sense.

02:38.801 --> 02:40.335
Um...

02:40.336 --> 02:42.269
How can you bounce
stuff off the moon?

02:42.270 --> 02:44.937
There's no gravity.

02:44.938 --> 02:46.205
Uh, Leonard,

02:46.206 --> 02:48.575
this is Zack.
Zack, Leonard.
Hey.

02:48.576 --> 02:50.807
Oh, sorry, I didn't know you
were busy. Maybe another time.

02:50.808 --> 02:51.805
Yeah, maybe.

02:51.806 --> 02:53.398
Hey, I want to see
this laser thing.

02:53.399 --> 02:55.118
Oh, but what about
the party?

02:55.119 --> 03:01.174
It's a surprise party-- doesn't
matter when we get there.

03:01.175 --> 03:02.886
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

03:09.313 --> 03:10.233
So, how'd you two guys meet?

03:10.836 --> 03:13.010
My company designs the menus doesn't
for the Cheesecake Factory.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.840
Your company?
Well,, my dad, but...

03:15.850 --> 03:17.270
but me and my sister are VPs.

03:18.852 --> 03:20.957
So... menus.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.687
I know it sounds easy but there's a lot
of science that goes in designing one.

03:31.050 --> 03:33.623
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

03:36.009 --> 03:36.962
Thank you.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.886
Raj, keep an eye out
for other one.

03:41.481 --> 03:43.486
Hey, guys, this is
my friend Zack.

03:43.487 --> 03:44.340
Hey.

03:44.341 --> 03:45.827
Hello.
Whoa!

03:45.828 --> 03:46.947
Ist the laser?

03:46.948 --> 03:48.720
It's bitchin'.

03:48.721 --> 03:50.126
Yes.

03:50.127 --> 03:53.320
In 1917, when Albert Einstein
established

03:53.321 --> 03:55.812
the theoretic foundation
for the laser in his paper

03:55.813 --> 03:58.706
<i>"Zur Quantentheorie der</i>
<i>Strahlung,"</i> his fondest hope

03:58.707 --> 04:01.899
was that the resultant device
be bitchin'.

04:02.586 --> 04:04.792
Well, mission
accomplished.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.733
Let me explain
what we're doing here.

04:09.734 --> 04:10.653
Um, in 1969,

04:10.654 --> 04:12.393
the astronauts
on <i>Apollo 11</i>

04:12.394 --> 04:14.099
positioned reflectors
on the surface of the moon,

04:14.100 --> 04:15.672
and we're going to
shoot a laser off

04:15.673 --> 04:17.512
one of them
and let the light bounce back

04:17.513 --> 04:18.966
into this photomultiplier.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.705
Oh! That's very cool.

04:20.706 --> 04:21.859
One question.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.985
How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

04:24.986 --> 04:26.005
The laser?

04:26.006 --> 04:27.345
The moon.

04:31.039 --> 04:33.512
See, now this is
a man for Penny.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.958
That's a great
question, Zack.

04:36.959 --> 04:37.811
No, it's not.

04:37.812 --> 04:38.798
Sheldon!

04:38.799 --> 04:40.118
Play nice.

04:40.119 --> 04:41.372
It's not a great question.

04:41.373 --> 04:42.778
How could somebody
possibly think

04:42.779 --> 04:44.517
we're going to
blow up the moon?

04:45.538 --> 04:48.531
<i>That's</i> a great question.

04:49.351 --> 04:50.437
Don't worry about the moon.

04:50.438 --> 04:52.777
We-We set our laser to stun.

04:52.778 --> 04:54.818
Smart.

04:56.033 --> 04:57.971
Now, we'll be able to see
the beam when it leaves,

04:57.972 --> 04:59.711
but it won't be strong enough
when it comes back

04:59.712 --> 05:00.850
to be seen by the naked eye.

05:00.851 --> 05:02.823
Naked.

05:06.971 --> 05:09.177
Right. Uh... funny.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.837
Uh, that device,
there, will measure
the photons that return

05:11.838 --> 05:14.077
and let us see it
on this computer.

05:14.078 --> 05:15.950
Raj, get them
some glasses.

05:15.951 --> 05:18.309
Cool, it's gonna
be in 3-D?

05:24.951 --> 05:27.910
Preparing to fire laser
at the moon.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.430
Make it so.

05:33.631 --> 05:35.117
There it is.
There's the spike!

05:35.118 --> 05:37.090
2.5 seconds for the
light to return.

05:37.091 --> 05:38.630
That's the moon!
We hit the moon!

05:43.245 --> 05:44.664
That's your big experiment?

05:44.665 --> 05:47.091
All that for
a line on the screen?

05:47.092 --> 05:48.511
Yeah, but, uh,

05:48.512 --> 05:49.917
think about
what this represents.

05:49.918 --> 05:50.937
The fact that

05:50.938 --> 05:53.177
we can do this
is the only way

05:53.178 --> 05:55.050
of definitively proving
that there are man-made objects

05:55.051 --> 05:57.643
on the moon, put there
by a member of a species

05:57.644 --> 06:00.803
that only 60 years before
had just invented the airplane.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.829
What species is that?

06:05.504 --> 06:06.656
I was wrong.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.682
Penny can do better.

06:08.683 --> 06:11.089
Okay, guys, thank you,
it's been fun.
Yeah, thanks.

06:11.090 --> 06:14.301
Should we invite
them to the party?
No, just keep walking.

06:16.651 --> 06:19.644
He must be very
skilled at coitus.

06:22.119 --> 06:24.277
I'm telling you, dude,
the only way

06:24.278 --> 06:26.984
to feel better about Penny
going out with other guys

06:26.985 --> 06:30.530
is for you to get back
on the whores.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.690
Horse.

06:33.691 --> 06:34.743
What?

06:34.744 --> 06:36.517
The phrase is "get
back on the horse,"

06:36.518 --> 06:38.843
not "whores."

06:39.429 --> 06:41.668
That's disgusting, dude.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.294
No, it's not...

06:44.295 --> 06:46.434
Never mind.

06:46.435 --> 06:47.521
He is right, though.

06:47.522 --> 06:50.147
If you want, I can turn
you on to this great new

06:50.148 --> 06:52.187
dating site I found.
No, thanks.

06:52.188 --> 06:54.327
You sure? They say they can
find a match for anybody.

06:54.970 --> 06:56.542
Have they found
a match for you?

06:56.543 --> 06:59.435
Tons. I've had, like, eight
dates in the last month.

06:59.436 --> 07:03.370
And 12 if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

07:03.371 --> 07:05.072
I can't bring
the nitrogen tank down.

07:05.073 --> 07:07.216
Why not?
All right, let me restate that.

07:07.217 --> 07:09.245
It's very heavy,
and I don't want to.

07:10.943 --> 07:11.885
I'll help you.

07:11.886 --> 07:13.136
Thank you.

07:13.606 --> 07:16.496
Lift with your knees,
not your back.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.496
Good night.

07:20.830 --> 07:22.528
You know what
<i>would</i> be fun?

07:22.529 --> 07:25.842
Signing Sheldon up
for online dating.

07:25.843 --> 07:26.848
Yeah, right.

07:26.849 --> 07:27.826
No, think about it.

07:27.827 --> 07:29.137
We make it an
experiment.

07:29.138 --> 07:30.549
Like when
Frankenstein's monster

07:30.550 --> 07:33.448
was lonely and
he found a wife.

07:33.449 --> 07:35.568
He didn't <i>find</i> a wife.

07:35.569 --> 07:39.208
They <i>built him</i> a wife
out of dead body parts.

07:40.153 --> 07:42.307
Okay, we'll call
that plan B.

07:48.878 --> 07:50.846
Coming!

07:53.382 --> 07:56.317
Damn you, you rat bastard.

07:56.318 --> 07:58.018
Are you drunk?

07:58.019 --> 08:01.488
Zack was a perfectly nice guy,
and then you ruined him!

08:01.589 --> 08:03.256
How did I ruin him?

08:03.384 --> 08:04.684
'Cause in the olden days,

08:04.685 --> 08:08.221
I never would've known
he was so stupid.

08:10.602 --> 08:13.136
Come on, he wasn't
that stupid.

08:13.137 --> 08:14.237
Yes, he was!

08:14.238 --> 08:16.072
He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon!

08:15.864 --> 08:18.831
Okay, yeah, he's stupid.

08:20.310 --> 08:22.178
He spent the entire
night bragging

08:22.179 --> 08:25.847
about how <i>he</i> invented
the word "appe-tease."

08:28.751 --> 08:31.118
How is that <i>my</i> fault?

08:31.119 --> 08:34.121
You have destroyed my ability
to tolerate idiots.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.522
Now, come with me.

08:35.523 --> 08:36.757
Wh-Where are we going?

08:36.758 --> 08:38.124
We're gonna have sex.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.326
Why? I mean, okay.

08:41.762 --> 08:43.729
What's going on?

08:43.730 --> 08:45.664
Put on your noise-
canceling headphones,

08:45.665 --> 08:47.832
'cause it's
gonna get loud.

08:49.401 --> 08:52.670
Oh! Not <i>this</i> again.

09:06.358 --> 09:10.691
In what universe
is this low-pulp?

09:12.595 --> 09:14.395
Good morning, Penny.

09:14.396 --> 09:17.130
What, do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

09:17.131 --> 09:19.900
When one gets beaten up
every other day in school,

09:19.901 --> 09:23.003
one of necessity develops
a keen sense of hearing.

09:23.972 --> 09:26.240
Incidentally, one can
get beaten up in school

09:26.241 --> 09:29.376
simply by referring
to oneself as "one."

09:29.377 --> 09:30.678
I'm making
English muffins.

09:30.679 --> 09:33.214
Would you like
an English muffin?

09:33.215 --> 09:35.750
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
FYI,

09:35.751 --> 09:39.649
my noise-canceling headphones
proved ineffective last night.

09:39.650 --> 09:42.681
Yeah, sorry about that.
As a native Texan,

09:42.682 --> 09:45.350
I must say I've never heard
the phrase "yee-haw"

09:45.351 --> 09:47.418
used in quite that context.

09:47.419 --> 09:49.386
Oh, God.

09:50.488 --> 09:52.522
"Oh, God."

09:52.523 --> 09:55.824
That I've heard
on multiple occasions.

09:59.695 --> 10:03.333
In what universe
is that lightly toasted?

10:05.972 --> 10:08.640
This has to be
the worst day of my life.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.542
Good morning, Leonard.

10:11.543 --> 10:14.745
How many times have
I asked you not to do that?

10:14.746 --> 10:18.614
Counting this instance? 317.

10:19.683 --> 10:21.049
Where's Penny?

10:21.050 --> 10:23.051
She returned
to her apartment.

10:23.052 --> 10:25.253
I presume to shower and vomit.

10:25.254 --> 10:28.054
Not necessarily in that order.

10:28.055 --> 10:29.823
I wonder why
she didn't say good-bye.

10:29.824 --> 10:34.827
Are you expecting me to offer an
explanation of human behavior?

10:34.828 --> 10:36.796
I know. I just
thought as an outsider,

10:36.797 --> 10:39.465
you might be able to provide
a fresh perspective.

10:43.236 --> 10:47.906
I have <i>no</i> difficulty
believing you're not butter.

10:50.710 --> 10:52.110
Oh, hey.
Oh, hi.

10:52.111 --> 10:54.045
Um, I gotta run.
Early shift.

10:54.046 --> 10:55.814
Okay, I'll walk
down with you.

10:55.815 --> 10:57.716
So, last night was
fun, huh?

10:57.717 --> 10:59.117
Yeah, it must have been.

10:59.118 --> 11:02.552
I just threw up
in my closet.

11:02.553 --> 11:03.586
Bummer.

11:03.587 --> 11:05.321
Anyway, I was thinking
tonight maybe

11:05.322 --> 11:06.688
we could catch a movie.

11:06.689 --> 11:08.589
Oh, yeah, tonight's
not great for me.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.057
Doesn't have
to be tonight.

11:10.058 --> 11:12.392
I'm free
pretty much always.

11:12.393 --> 11:15.261
Leonard, last night
was a mistake.

11:15.262 --> 11:18.230
When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake,

11:18.231 --> 11:21.332
like the discovery
of penicillin?

11:21.333 --> 11:22.933
Look, I'm sorry.

11:22.934 --> 11:25.503
I was drunk, I was lonely,
I hated Zack.

11:25.504 --> 11:27.338
Can we just forget
it ever happened?

11:27.339 --> 11:30.540
No, it's pretty well imprinted
on my brain.

11:30.541 --> 11:33.009
Especially
the whole rodeo thing.

11:33.010 --> 11:34.677
Oh, God!

11:34.678 --> 11:35.978
So, that's it?

11:35.979 --> 11:37.579
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

11:37.580 --> 11:40.148
Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't u please let it go?

11:40.149 --> 11:41.748
How am I supposed to let it go?

11:41.749 --> 11:43.617
You used me for sex!

11:46.822 --> 11:49.157
Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

11:49.158 --> 11:50.725
Good morning, Leonard.

11:50.726 --> 11:53.895
Or should I say "yee-haw"?

12:00.935 --> 12:03.503
Holy crap.
What?

12:03.504 --> 12:07.707
We finally have proof
that aliens walk among us.

12:07.708 --> 12:08.841
Excuse me?

12:08.842 --> 12:11.710
The dating site matched a woman
with Sheldon.

12:11.711 --> 12:13.211
You're kidding.

12:13.212 --> 12:14.412
An actual woman?

12:14.413 --> 12:17.713
Yeah, look.
Breasts and everything.

12:17.714 --> 12:20.982
Trust me, breasts doesn'
necessarily mean woman.

12:20.983 --> 12:23.350
Since when?
I'll show you a picture

12:23.351 --> 12:26.386
Trust of my Uncle Louie in a
bathing suit sometime.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.723
Leonard,
you gotta see this.

12:29.724 --> 12:31.425
We found a match
for Sheldon.

12:31.426 --> 12:32.726
Great.

12:32.727 --> 12:35.328
Maybe she can have sex with him,
and then walk out on him

12:35.329 --> 12:38.364
the next morning without so much
as a "How do you do?"

12:38.365 --> 12:39.798
Do you know what
he's talking about?

12:39.799 --> 12:40.999
Nope.
Why don't you ask him?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.167
Leonard, what are you talking
about?

12:42.168 --> 12:43.369
I don't want
to talk about it.

12:43.370 --> 12:45.705
That was
a lousy suggestion.

12:45.706 --> 12:47.573
Whatever.
Right now,

12:47.574 --> 12:50.108
Dr. Sheldon Cooper has
to send an e-mail

12:50.109 --> 12:51.842
to his perfect match.

12:51.843 --> 12:55.111
"Greetings,
fellow life-form..."

12:57.848 --> 13:01.684
If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.

13:01.685 --> 13:03.787
If she can do it, I can do it.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.690
I can't do it.

13:07.059 --> 13:09.294
Hello?
Oh, hi. Hey.

13:09.295 --> 13:10.629
Hi, Leslie.

13:12.398 --> 13:14.432
Leonard Hofstadter.
What're you doing here?

13:14.433 --> 13:16.765
Uh, I know!
It's been a while!

13:16.766 --> 13:18.132
Yeah, 18 months.

13:18.133 --> 13:20.500
Right. Right.

13:20.501 --> 13:23.402
So how you doing?

13:23.403 --> 13:25.436
Fine. You?

13:25.437 --> 13:26.837
Uh, not bad.

13:26.838 --> 13:29.406
You remember when
we used to have sex

13:29.407 --> 13:32.640
and you said that it didn't mean
anything, it was just for fun?

13:32.641 --> 13:33.641
Yeah.

13:33.642 --> 13:37.078
You, uh, want
to do that again?

13:38.850 --> 13:40.621
What happened?
Blondie dumped you?

13:40.622 --> 13:41.788
She didn't dump me.

13:41.789 --> 13:44.157
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

13:44.158 --> 13:45.591
Right.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.960
Um... anyway,
apparently,

13:47.961 --> 13:50.529
it's okay to go back to people
you're no longer seeing

13:50.530 --> 13:52.664
and have recreational sex
with them.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.598
Uh-huh.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.334
So, what do you say?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.469
Let me think about it.

14:05.408 --> 14:08.577
She's not coming back.

14:09.779 --> 14:11.980
Uh-oh.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.948
She wants to meet us.

14:13.949 --> 14:15.483
Not us. Him.

14:15.484 --> 14:17.885
Yes, but him doesn't
even know about her.

14:17.886 --> 14:20.987
Well, him about to
find out about her.

14:20.988 --> 14:23.256
Really? Us gonna tell him?

14:23.257 --> 14:25.291
Who's going to tell
whom about what?

14:25.292 --> 14:26.459
Sheldon.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.027
Hey. Hi.

14:28.028 --> 14:30.028
Your surprise confuses me.

14:30.029 --> 14:32.097
I live here.

14:32.932 --> 14:34.365
Right.

14:34.366 --> 14:38.169
So, listen, what are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

14:38.170 --> 14:39.603
Be more specific.

14:39.604 --> 14:40.804
4:30.

14:40.805 --> 14:42.039
That's not afternoon.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.507
That's preevning.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.509
What?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.177
It's a time of day I invented.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.713
It better defines
the ambiguous period

14:49.714 --> 14:53.283
between afternoon and evening:
preevning.

14:53.284 --> 14:56.886
I'm fairly certain it will catch
on as it fills a desperate need.

14:56.887 --> 14:58.354
Right, okay.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.757
What are you doing
tomorrow preevning?

15:00.758 --> 15:02.292
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

15:02.293 --> 15:04.059
Saturday night is laundry night.

15:04.060 --> 15:07.126
So I'll be spending
the preevning pre-sorting

15:07.127 --> 15:08.658
and pre-soaking.

15:08.659 --> 15:12.360
Okay, what if I
were to tell you,
tomorrow, at 4:30,

15:12.361 --> 15:14.962
you could meet a woman who has
been scientifically chosen

15:14.963 --> 15:16.930
to be your perfect mate?

15:16.931 --> 15:20.266
I would snort in derision
and throw my arms in the air,

15:20.267 --> 15:24.069
exhausted
by your constant tomfoolery.

15:24.070 --> 15:25.571
But it's true.

15:27.340 --> 15:30.175
But we-we put all
your vital information

15:30.176 --> 15:31.376
into this dating site,

15:31.377 --> 15:33.477
answered all their questions
just like you would,

15:33.478 --> 15:35.312
and they found
a match for you.

15:35.313 --> 15:37.547
Her name is
Amy Farrah Fowler.

15:37.548 --> 15:38.949
Please.

15:38.950 --> 15:40.750
Even assuming
you could answer any question

15:40.751 --> 15:42.551
the way I would,
the algorithms used

15:42.552 --> 15:44.987
by matchmaking sites
are complete hokum.

15:44.988 --> 15:47.222
And that's exactly the answer
we gave to the question:

15:47.223 --> 15:48.890
"What is your attitude
towards online dating?"

15:48.891 --> 15:52.827
Howard wanted to write
"mumbo jumbo," but I said no.

15:52.828 --> 15:56.563
Our Sheldon would
say "hokum."

15:58.466 --> 16:00.933
Come on, where's your
scientific curiosity?

16:00.934 --> 16:02.367
Well, most of it
is being applied

16:02.368 --> 16:03.902
to unraveling the secrets
of the universe

16:03.903 --> 16:05.437
while the rest of it's
wondering why

16:05.438 --> 16:07.372
I'm having this conversation
with you.

16:07.373 --> 16:09.341
Okay, how about this.

16:09.342 --> 16:13.078
Even Spock had a date
once every seven years.

16:13.079 --> 16:14.246
He didn't date.

16:14.247 --> 16:15.514
It was <i>pon farr.</i>

16:15.515 --> 16:17.882
His blood boiled
with mating lust.

16:17.883 --> 16:20.652
Well, why-why don't you
start with a cup of coffee,

16:20.653 --> 16:24.622
and you can <i>pon farr</i>
Amy Farrah Fowler later.

16:24.623 --> 16:26.157
I don't drink coffee.

16:26.158 --> 16:28.124
All right, you can
have a hot chocolate.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.290
As I will not be engaging
in this nonsense,

16:30.291 --> 16:31.689
my choice of beverage is moot.

16:31.690 --> 16:32.757
But for the record,

16:32.758 --> 16:34.125
I only drink hot chocolate

16:34.126 --> 16:36.260
in months with an "R" in them.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.895
Why?

16:37.896 --> 16:40.064
What's life without whimsy?

16:41.833 --> 16:44.534
Okay, I'm out.

16:49.771 --> 16:53.406
Sheldon, I've hidden
the dirty sock

16:53.407 --> 16:55.808
from the roof somewhere
in your apartment.

16:57.910 --> 17:00.611
Unless you are willing to come
with us to meet this girl,

17:00.612 --> 17:02.780
it will remain there forever.

17:04.282 --> 17:06.149
You're bluffing.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.317
Are you willing to risk it?

17:09.219 --> 17:11.620
Curse you.

17:33.410 --> 17:36.312
30 feet.

17:43.252 --> 17:45.553
Oh. Hey, Leonard.

17:45.554 --> 17:49.155
I was a perfectly happy,
geeky, little lonely guy,

17:49.156 --> 17:52.123
and you ruined me!

17:52.124 --> 17:54.024
Are you drunk?

17:54.025 --> 17:56.760
Come on. We're gonna have sex,
and it's not gonna mean a thing!

17:56.761 --> 18:00.229
Are you out
of your mind?!

18:02.299 --> 18:05.868
I'm really starting to think
there's a double standard here.

18:11.471 --> 18:12.772
In a few minutes,

18:12.806 --> 18:15.574
when I gloat over the
failure of this enterprise,

18:15.575 --> 18:17.442
how would you
prefer I do it?

18:17.443 --> 18:18.777
The standard
"I told you so"?

18:18.778 --> 18:20.412
The classic
"neener-neener"?

18:20.413 --> 18:23.181
Or just my normal look
of haughty derision?

18:25.417 --> 18:26.984
You don't know
we're wrong yet.

18:26.985 --> 18:29.920
Haughty derision it is.

18:29.921 --> 18:31.254
Excuse me.

18:31.255 --> 18:32.455
I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.

18:32.456 --> 18:33.689
You're Sheldon Cooper.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.690
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

18:35.691 --> 18:38.658
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been taken in

18:38.659 --> 18:40.993
by unsupportable mathematics

18:40.994 --> 18:42.961
designed to prey
on the gullible and the lonely.

18:42.962 --> 18:45.063
Additionally,
I'm being blackmailed

18:45.064 --> 18:46.998
with a hidden dirty sock.

18:46.999 --> 18:51.201
If that was slang,
I'm unfamiliar with it.

18:51.202 --> 18:54.871
If it was literal, I share your
aversion to soiled hosiery.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.372
In any case,

18:56.373 --> 18:58.440
I'm here because my
mother and I have agreed

18:58.441 --> 19:00.675
that I will date at
least once a year.

19:00.676 --> 19:01.976
Interesting.

19:01.977 --> 19:05.280
My mother and I have
the same agreement about church.

19:05.281 --> 19:07.584
I don't object to the
concept of a deity,

19:07.585 --> 19:10.786
but I'm baffled by the notion
of one that takes attendance.

19:10.787 --> 19:14.556
Well, then you might want
to avoid East Texas.

19:14.557 --> 19:15.757
Noted.

19:15.758 --> 19:17.358
Now, before this
goes any further,

19:17.359 --> 19:19.794
you should know that all
forms of physical contact

19:19.795 --> 19:23.096
up to and including
coitus are off the table.

19:24.699 --> 19:26.866
May I buy you a beverage?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.435
Tepid water, please.

19:38.275 --> 19:40.676
Good God, what
have we done?
