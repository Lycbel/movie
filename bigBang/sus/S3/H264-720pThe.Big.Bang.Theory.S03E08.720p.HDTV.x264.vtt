00:02.300 --> 00:03.240
How much time do we have?

00:03.270 --> 00:06.740
Uh,t-minus five hours, 37
minutes to onset of meteor shower.

00:06.750 --> 00:11.900
Okay,our position is 34. 48
degrees north, 118.31 west.

00:11.910 --> 00:13.790
That means the azimuth should be...

00:13.800 --> 00:19.670
168. 22 degrees relative to magnetic
north with an elevation of 49.93.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.400
Anything yet?

00:20.440 --> 00:22.640
Uh,we have a signal, but
there's no frame lock.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.940
Hang on. How about... Now?

00:25.950 --> 00:29.600
We did it. We have the
west coast feed of hbo.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.180
Ooh,real sex.

00:33.190 --> 00:37.920
Big deal. Every time I watch that show,
it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.130
All right,let's see what's
on the east coast feed.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.850
Dune.

00:46.550 --> 00:50.510
Not a great movie, but look
at that beautiful desert.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.260
Too bad sheldon couldn't come with us.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.570
Yeah,it's just not the same without him.

01:04.510 --> 01:07.960
Oh,this sucks. I'm
switching back toreal sex.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.910
Sheldon's log.

01:13.410 --> 01:16.760
Stardate 63345.3

01:16.770 --> 01:20.300
While my colleagues are off
observing the leonid meteor shower,

01:20.320 --> 01:26.230
I have remained behind to complete my paper on
the decays of highly excited massive string states.

01:26.240 --> 01:31.650
Although my research is going well, I do
Miss the warmth of human companionship.

The Big Bang
Theory Season03 Episode08

02:04.590 --> 02:08.800
And good evening to you, siam
palace. This is sheldon cooper.

02:08.810 --> 02:13.470
Yeah,I'm going to be dining alone this
evening, so i'll be reducing my usual order.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.180
I'd like to start with one quarter
of the assorted appetizers plate and,

02:18.190 --> 02:21.940
uh,one half of the
golden treasure for two.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.470
Oh,for heaven's sake.In
the mid-18th century,

02:25.480 --> 02:28.720
king rama iv of siam
divided a huge empire

02:28.750 --> 02:32.130
amongst the colonial powers of europe
in order to preserve his throne.

02:32.140 --> 02:36.600
Surely,you, his cultural descendant,
can handle pad thai and dumplings.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.430
Sheldon,help!

02:38.470 --> 02:42.640
I need to go-But you keep in mind that
my sharply worded comments on yelp.Com

02:42.650 --> 02:45.460
recently took down a local muffin store.

02:48.670 --> 02:53.270
- Penny. Penny. Penny.
- Come in! Hurry!

02:55.950 --> 02:58.650
- Penny?
- I'm back here.

03:02.290 --> 03:05.120
Penny. Penny. Penny.

03:05.130 --> 03:07.870
Oh,for god's sakes, i'm in the bathroom!

03:08.330 --> 03:10.810
Shall I come back at a better time?

03:11.850 --> 03:16.120
Get in here! Hurry!

03:17.690 --> 03:20.180
Don't you dare knock!

03:23.580 --> 03:25.210
Hello.

03:25.220 --> 03:28.600
I slipped in the shower, and I
think I dislocated my shoulder.

03:29.540 --> 03:30.480
Not surprising.

03:30.510 --> 03:34.400
You have no safety mat or adhesive
stickers to allow for purchase on a surface

03:34.440 --> 03:37.050
with a low coefficient
of static friction.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.970
What?

03:39.980 --> 03:42.150
Tubs are slippery.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.070
I know. I slipped.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.760
I have a series of whimsical duck
stickers on the bottom of my tub.

03:48.410 --> 03:51.830
Yeah,okay,whatever. Will you just
turn the water off and help me up?

03:52.590 --> 03:54.570
They're holding umbrellas.

03:55.170 --> 03:58.010
- What?
- The ducks in my tub.

03:58.730 --> 04:03.580
They're whimsical because ducks have neither
a need for, nor the ability to use, umbrellas.

04:03.590 --> 04:06.330
Oh,my god. I got to go
to the emergency room.

04:06.340 --> 04:10.120
Well,assuming you're correct that your right
humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket,

04:10.150 --> 04:11.700
I would certainly think so.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.880
- Okay,can you drive me?
- I don't drive.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.950
Well,I can't drive!

04:16.140 --> 04:18.480
Well,it seems we've reached an impasse.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.320
I could call you a cab or an ambulance.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.380
No,no,no. I can't wait that
long. You got to help me,please.

04:25.950 --> 04:31.230
All right. Let it never be said that sheldon lee
cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.220
No one's saying that. Let's go.

04:33.230 --> 04:36.900
Well,it does seem rather ironic that
for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

04:36.920 --> 04:40.270
we both might die in a fiery car crash.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.280
I wish penny didn't have
to work. She loves camping.

04:44.290 --> 04:45.890
Yeah,that would have been great.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.310
You and penny having sex in the tent while I
sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus.

04:52.300 --> 04:56.400
Okay,the best I can tell, there
are eight other campsites nearby.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.390
Mostly science nerds like
us, but just over yon ridge

05:00.410 --> 05:05.330
are two not unattractive middle school
teachers who reek of desperation.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.070
Wonderful. How old are they?

05:08.080 --> 05:11.100
I don't know. 50,55.

05:11.110 --> 05:14.320
Oh,menopause.

05:14.330 --> 05:17.010
Nature's birth control.

05:17.020 --> 05:20.220
Come on. You guys can't be that hard up.

05:20.230 --> 05:22.360
- I am.
- Yeah,me,too.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.230
Look-they gave me homemade cookies.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.100
Of course,they did. That's
what grandmothers do.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.800
So,what are we waiting for?

05:29.810 --> 05:34.010
Relax. I said we'd stop by a little
later after they have their nap.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.080
Good idea. They'll be refreshed.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.450
- Cookie?
- Thank you.

05:43.930 --> 05:46.460
- Not bad.
- Yeah,very tasty.

05:46.470 --> 05:48.260
Well,so tell me more
about these teachers.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.470
Not much to tell.

05:49.490 --> 05:53.970
They had a vw microbus and were
wearing tie-dyed grateful dead t-shirts.

05:58.950 --> 06:01.310
Good cookies.

06:05.690 --> 06:09.610
I see no organizational
system in here whatsoever.

06:10.510 --> 06:13.320
Which panties do you wear on mondays?

06:13.330 --> 06:16.060
I don't need panties. I
just need shorts and a shirt.

06:16.070 --> 06:20.380
My mother always told me one should wear
clean underpants in case one is in an accident.

06:20.390 --> 06:22.370
One was already in an accident.

06:22.390 --> 06:26.170
That doesn't mean one won't be in
another, especially if I'm driving.

06:26.180 --> 06:29.850
- Clothes,sheldon. I need clothes!
- Okay. Here.

06:29.860 --> 06:32.750
Seriously? Those shorts with that top?

06:33.990 --> 06:36.250
All right.

06:36.580 --> 06:38.670
No.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.110
No.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.900
Oh,that's cute.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.140
We should have you
checked for a concussion.

06:48.870 --> 06:51.370
Okay. Now,you got to
help me put these on.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.630
- All right.
- But don't look.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.430
- Don't look?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.310
Well,that's understandable.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.440
You may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking

07:02.450 --> 07:04.730
is well established in heroic mythology.

07:04.740 --> 07:09.090
Uh,lot and his wife, perseus and
medusa, orpheus and eurydice...

07:09.100 --> 07:12.340
- Yeah,great.
- They always look. It never ends well.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.480
Okay. Now you got help me
get my arm into the sleeve.

07:15.490 --> 07:17.680
Okay.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.130
Is that my arm?

07:24.930 --> 07:27.910
It doesn't feel like an arm.

07:28.810 --> 07:31.960
Then,maybe you should let it go.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.190
All righty.

07:47.450 --> 07:50.260
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.390
Up above the world so high.

07:54.410 --> 07:57.360
Like little diamonds in the sky.

07:57.750 --> 08:01.120
That's beautiful,dude.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.610
You should... You should write
that down before someone steals it.

08:04.620 --> 08:06.630
So,when do the meteors get here?

08:06.660 --> 08:10.640
The meteors don't get here. The
earth is moving into their path.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.480
I can feel it.

08:14.340 --> 08:17.730
I can feel the earth moving.

08:18.950 --> 08:22.120
It's moving too fast. Raj,slow it down.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.100
Okay,how's that?

08:33.700 --> 08:36.420
Better. Thanks.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.950
Stars are pretty, aren't they?

08:43.850 --> 08:44.970
What's so funny?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.850
It's your american accent.
Everything you say sounds stupid.

08:50.290 --> 08:53.120
"stars are pretty,aren't they?"

09:01.430 --> 09:07.470
For the record,I should let you know this is
my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.400
You have your learner's permit,right?

09:10.440 --> 09:14.480
Yes,and I have logged a considerable
number of hours on a simulator.

09:14.490 --> 09:16.880
- Good.
- Didn't work out well.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.180
- All right,can we please go?
- One moment.

09:19.190 --> 09:23.270
According to my driver's ed book,
the side mirror is properly adjusted

09:23.300 --> 09:27.100
when a portion of the driver's door handle
is visible in the lower right corner.

09:27.110 --> 09:32.010
There's the handle. Oh,no,too
far. Bringing it back.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.100
Optimized.

09:34.110 --> 09:37.410
Now,where is the switch to
adjust the passenger side mirror?

09:37.420 --> 09:39.300
It's right there.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.220
Where is the passenger side mirror?

09:44.550 --> 09:48.350
In a parking lot in hollywood.
Now,can we please go?

09:48.360 --> 09:51.520
Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.590
Whee!

10:00.840 --> 10:03.810
Oh,dear. I'm going to
have to start again.

10:12.530 --> 10:18.590
if I could speak the language of rabbits, they
would be amazed, and I would be their king.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.820
I hate my name.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.000
It has "nerd" in it.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.640
Len-nerd.

10:33.930 --> 10:37.220
I lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie.

10:38.870 --> 10:42.360
I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.270
At first.

10:46.280 --> 10:50.180
You know what's a cool name? Angelo.

10:51.710 --> 10:55.050
That has angel and jell-o in it.

10:55.630 --> 10:57.640
It was my uncle murray's funeral.

10:57.670 --> 11:00.170
We were all back at my
aunt barbara's house.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.800
Our eyes locked over
the pickled herring.

11:02.810 --> 11:05.570
We never meant for it to happen.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.270
One day,I hold a great ball
for the president of france,

11:09.280 --> 11:11.500
but the rabbits-They
hate me and don't come.

11:11.530 --> 11:16.040
I am embarrassed,so I eat all the
lettuce in the world and make them watch.

11:17.930 --> 11:20.630
People could call me angie.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.910
Yo,angie,how's it goin'?

11:26.040 --> 11:31.180
To this day,I can't look at pickled
herring without being aroused and ashamed.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.220
Cousin jeanie.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.730
Could you please drive a little faster?

11:42.740 --> 11:45.900
Oh,I think we're going
sufficiently fast.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.570
- What's that?
- Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.060
It can't be nothing. The
check engine light is on.

11:53.070 --> 11:56.860
- We need to find a service station.
- No. The light has been on since I bought the car.

11:57.240 --> 12:00.880
All the more reason to consult
with a mechanic before it explodes.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.630
It's not going to
explode. Just keep driving.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.530
Warp speed ahead,Mr. Spock.

12:08.140 --> 12:11.190
Mr. Spock did not pilot theenterprise.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.800
He was the science officer,

12:12.840 --> 12:16.190
and I guarantee you that if he ever saw
theenterprise's check engine light blinking,

12:16.210 --> 12:18.960
he would pull the ship over immediately.

12:19.970 --> 12:22.600
Oh,god,I'm gonna lose the arm.

12:22.630 --> 12:25.740
Oh,well,red light.Release accelerator

12:25.750 --> 12:30.560
and slowly apply... The... Brake.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.540
Nailed it.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.810
- While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
- What?

12:41.820 --> 12:46.430
Why do you have the chinese character
for soup tattooed on your right buttock?

12:47.110 --> 12:50.120
It's not soup. It's courage.

12:50.130 --> 12:51.990
No,it isn't.

12:52.020 --> 12:56.520
But I suppose it does take courage to
demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.860
How did you see it? You
said you wouldn't look.

13:00.870 --> 13:05.270
Sorry. As I told you,the
hero always peeks.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.370
- Anything?
- No. That was the last pudding cup.

13:18.220 --> 13:22.560
No! What about slim jims?

13:22.990 --> 13:26.030
That's what he used to
eat his pudding,remember?

13:26.830 --> 13:30.480
Right. That was so good!

13:30.980 --> 13:33.920
Sweety and meaty at the same time.

13:34.290 --> 13:37.890
Wait. Wait,wait. So you're
saying we're out of food?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.720
The only thing in here
are blue ice packs.

13:41.460 --> 13:46.840
I know they're poison, but they
look like big, yummy otter pops.

13:47.610 --> 13:49.760
Oh,god,I am so hungry.

13:49.770 --> 13:51.140
Me,too.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.900
Check and see if we
have any more pudding.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.790
Okay.

14:01.250 --> 14:04.430
All right,there's no need to bark at me.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.760
According to the inexplicably
irritable nurse behind the desk,

14:08.790 --> 14:11.260
you'll be seen after the man who
claims to be having a heart attack,

14:11.280 --> 14:15.210
but appears to be well enough to
play doodle jump on his iphone.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.400
We have to fill these out.

14:19.590 --> 14:22.150
"describe illness or injury."

14:22.180 --> 14:24.410
I dislocated my shoulder.

14:24.710 --> 14:28.680
All right. And how
did the accident occur?

14:28.690 --> 14:31.220
You already know that.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.180
"cause of accident."

14:33.200 --> 14:36.040
"lack of adhesive ducks."

14:38.670 --> 14:40.180
Okay,medical history.

14:40.220 --> 14:42.940
- "have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
- No.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.720
- Kidney disease?
- No.

14:44.730 --> 14:47.260
- Migraines?
- Getting one.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.900
- "are you currently pregnant?"
- No.

14:49.910 --> 14:52.890
Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.

14:54.950 --> 14:57.600
Change migraine to yes.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.920
- "when was your last menstrual period?"
- Next question.

15:01.930 --> 15:04.970
I'll put,"in progress."

15:06.000 --> 15:08.490
Okay,moving to psychiatric disorders.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.970
"list all major behavioral diagnoses,
"e.g.Depression, anxiety,etcetera."

15:13.010 --> 15:16.330
Oh,my god,what the hell does this
have to do with my stupid shoulder?

15:16.340 --> 15:19.640
"episodes of sub psychotic rage."

15:21.450 --> 15:24.970
- Ass.
- "possible tourette's."

15:26.320 --> 15:29.740
All right. "moles,lesions
or other skin conditions."

15:29.750 --> 15:32.950
"soup tattoo on right buttock."

15:32.960 --> 15:36.940
Hey,sheldon, sheldon,look, I
am scared and in a lot of pain.

15:36.970 --> 15:41.320
Could you please take a break from being
you for just a minute and try being--

15:41.330 --> 15:44.590
I don't know-Comforting?

15:45.760 --> 15:49.940
I'm sorry. There,there.

15:51.430 --> 15:54.160
Everything's going to be fine.

16:02.110 --> 16:04.890
Sheldon's here.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.390
Thanks. That's much better.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.250
Oh,I'm so hungry!

16:18.270 --> 16:21.540
Will you shut up? We're all hungry.

16:21.890 --> 16:25.160
Okay,our objective is the boy
scout campsite to the east.

16:25.180 --> 16:29.380
Easy target. Big doughy scout
master, couple of cubs,mostly webelos.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.330
What kind of score we looking at?

16:31.370 --> 16:34.660
Hot dogs,buns,s'mores. I
mean,it's a freaking 7-11.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.800
All right, everyone grab flashlights.

16:40.230 --> 16:43.810
Oh,my god,could it be? Yes!

16:43.820 --> 16:46.700
My mother put an "i love
you" brisket in my backpack.

16:46.710 --> 16:47.750
Quick,get forks.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.030
You don't need forks. It's so
tender, it falls apart in your hands.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.090
He's right.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.320
I feel like we're forgetting
something important.

17:04.330 --> 17:07.100
Me,too. But what?

17:08.750 --> 17:13.150
Maybe a tupperware bowl of
roasted potatoes and carrots?

17:13.160 --> 17:16.210
Yes! Yes!

17:19.300 --> 17:24.590
Now remember,you were given powerful
pain medication and a muscle relaxer,

17:24.620 --> 17:28.010
so,uh,don't operate heavy machinery.

17:29.980 --> 17:33.160
Try not to choke on your own drool.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.660
Wait. You have to help me get into bed.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.560
Sheldon has to get me into bed.

17:44.650 --> 17:47.680
Bet you never thought i'd say that.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.990
Yes.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.110
The charm of your drug-addled
candor knows no bounds.

17:57.230 --> 18:01.820
You know,people think you're this weird
robot man who's so annoying all the time,

18:01.830 --> 18:03.810
and you totally are.

18:04.610 --> 18:08.920
But then it's like that
movie wall-eat the end.

18:08.930 --> 18:15.850
You're so full of love, and you can save a plant
and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.

18:17.270 --> 18:21.980
That's a fairly labored metaphor, but
I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.440
Sing "soft kitty" to me.

18:29.090 --> 18:32.370
"soft kitty" is for when
you're sick. You're not sick.

18:32.380 --> 18:35.880
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.

18:44.810 --> 18:50.670
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

18:50.680 --> 18:55.390
Wait,wait. Let's sing it
as a round. I'll start.

18:57.710 --> 19:03.870
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

19:04.850 --> 19:08.050
So,that's where you
come in. I'll start over.

19:08.920 --> 19:14.880
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

19:18.300 --> 19:21.490
I've got all night,sheldon.

19:21.500 --> 19:27.820
Soft kitty,warm kitty,
little ball of fur...

19:28.380 --> 19:35.080
Happy kitty, sleepy
kitty,purr,purr,purr purr,purr,purr.

19:45.830 --> 19:51.960
And the next morning when he woke
up, he rolled over and realized...

19:52.320 --> 19:55.200
Duh-duh-duh!

19:56.250 --> 19:59.440
She was his cousin.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.380
That's still not funny.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.870
That's still not funny.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.200
And she was my second cousin.

20:15.210 --> 20:18.090
And she was my second cousin.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.660
You're a real douche.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.700
Who cares? You slept with your cousin.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.230
