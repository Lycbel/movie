WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:05.188
Look at us. Getting ready for a double date

00:05.256 --> 00:07.324
with actual women who publicly acknowledge

00:07.391 --> 00:09.826
they're our girlfriends.

00:09.894 --> 00:13.196
Yes, actual women are the best.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.264
I don't understand.

00:14.332 --> 00:15.665
What other kind of women are there?

00:15.733 --> 00:18.668
Howard, artificial women
are your department.

00:18.736 --> 00:21.671
You want to take this?

00:21.739 --> 00:24.708
No, it would just freak him out.

00:24.775 --> 00:27.210
Listen, before we leave,

00:27.278 --> 00:30.213
I should warn you, I'm a passionate man

00:30.281 --> 00:33.750
and I tend towards public
displays of affection.

00:33.818 --> 00:37.654
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

00:37.722 --> 00:40.357
There might be some making out
in the car or the restaurant,

00:40.424 --> 00:42.259
and I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable,

00:42.326 --> 00:46.096
so it would help if you
and Penny made out, too.

00:46.164 --> 00:48.098
Don't worry.

00:48.166 --> 00:50.390
We're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.394
<i>Namaste, white people.</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:57.096
Good news!

00:57.164 --> 01:00.400
<i>I rented us the fou
r-hour edition of Watchmen.</i>

01:00.467 --> 01:01.334
Got it. Seen it.

01:01.402 --> 01:03.836
Detailed analysis posted online.

01:03.904 --> 01:06.205
Well, then what are we going to do tonight?

01:06.273 --> 01:07.440
Uh, sorry, Raj.

01:07.508 --> 01:08.641
Howard and I are going out to dinner

01:08.709 --> 01:10.009
with Penny and Bernadette. Yeah.

01:10.077 --> 01:12.712
No more carefree bachelor
nights for me and Leonard.

01:12.780 --> 01:15.248
These broncos have been saddled.

01:20.154 --> 01:22.121
<i>How did we get actual women?</i>

01:22.189 --> 01:24.123
Great.

01:24.191 --> 01:26.025
They get girlfriends,
and they just abandon us?

01:26.093 --> 01:27.994
It is great, isn't it?

01:29.330 --> 01:31.397
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us. We do?

01:31.465 --> 01:33.566
Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have

01:33.634 --> 01:35.902
enough room on my hard drive
for a Linux partition,

01:35.970 --> 01:38.237
so you and I are going
to perform a full backup,

01:38.305 --> 01:41.574
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

01:41.642 --> 01:44.043
I don't want to do that.

01:44.111 --> 01:45.378
All right.

01:45.446 --> 01:47.380
Well, I'm going to perform full backup,

01:47.448 --> 01:50.883
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

01:50.951 --> 01:51.985
What about me?

01:52.052 --> 01:53.987
Well, I understand

01:54.054 --> 01:56.956
there are several types of artificial women.

01:58.325 --> 02:00.426
Maybe you should look into that.

02:02.162 --> 02:05.698
* Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state *

02:05.766 --> 02:09.524
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

02:09.592 --> 02:10.259
* The Earth began to cool *

02:10.327 --> 02:12.828
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

02:12.896 --> 02:15.364
<i>* We built the Wall * *
We built the pyramids *</i>

02:15.432 --> 02:18.034
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

02:18.101 --> 02:19.936
* That all started with a big bang *

02:19.638 --> 02:23.638
Sync by Drou

02:28.422 --> 02:30.023
Dude, there's so many cool things

02:30.091 --> 02:31.892
we could be doing tonight. Look.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.727
At the Glendale Galleria,

02:33.795 --> 02:35.729
"Put on your best zoot suit,

02:35.797 --> 02:38.632
"it's a salute to Swing music
in the center court near Macy's.

02:38.699 --> 02:39.800
5:00 p.m. to 9 p.m."

02:39.867 --> 02:41.802
Huh? Huh?

02:44.561 --> 02:45.529
Sounds like a hoot.

02:46.096 --> 02:47.463
I'm sorry, Raj,

02:47.531 --> 02:50.500
I have no desire to salute any
article of clothing tonight.

02:50.567 --> 02:54.003
Much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

02:54.071 --> 02:55.104
Race riots?

02:55.172 --> 02:57.473
The zoot suit riots.

02:57.541 --> 03:00.143
Oh.

03:00.210 --> 03:04.347
I always thought that was some
sort of after-Christmas sale.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.284
Well, then why don't we just go
to the galleria and walk around?

03:08.352 --> 03:10.286
But I don't need anything at the Galleria.

03:10.354 --> 03:11.954
Do you need anything at the Galleria?

03:12.022 --> 03:13.856
No. We would just walk
around and see what's what.

03:15.893 --> 03:19.295
That's a semantically null sentence.

03:19.363 --> 03:21.798
Okay, well, how about this?

03:21.865 --> 03:23.633
From the university Web site:

03:23.700 --> 03:26.636
7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room,

03:26.703 --> 03:29.305
"mixer for grad students and faculty

03:29.373 --> 03:31.808
"of the science and humanities departments.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.810
"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,

03:33.877 --> 03:36.712
this is the place to be."

03:36.780 --> 03:39.982
Well, that's certainly amusing, but...

03:40.050 --> 03:42.018
I have no interest.

03:42.086 --> 03:43.686
Come on, Sheldon,

03:43.754 --> 03:46.022
the world is filled with
people doing things outside.

03:46.090 --> 03:47.356
Let's go outside.

03:47.424 --> 03:49.826
Outside is good.

03:49.893 --> 03:52.829
If outside is so good,
why has mankind spent thousands of years

03:52.896 --> 03:54.597
trying to perfect inside?

03:54.665 --> 03:56.866
I don't know, it's a marketing scheme.

03:58.302 --> 03:59.735
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,

03:59.803 --> 04:01.860
virile visitor from a foreign land

04:01.888 --> 04:05.157
and I need to strut my stuff.

04:05.224 --> 04:07.526
Let me offer you a compromise.

04:07.594 --> 04:11.063
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery,

04:11.130 --> 04:14.099
I use my imagination.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.300
Oh, boy.

04:15.368 --> 04:17.169
One of my favorite places

04:17.236 --> 04:19.071
to visit is the two-dimensional world

04:19.138 --> 04:21.573
described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy,

04:21.641 --> 04:22.808
"Flatland."

04:22.875 --> 04:25.444
I don't want to go to Flatland.

04:25.511 --> 04:27.446
You're only saying that because
you haven't been there.

04:30.617 --> 04:34.119
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space

04:34.187 --> 04:37.456
and can only perceive the
edges of other objects.

04:37.523 --> 04:39.625
Oy.

04:39.692 --> 04:41.627
Is that you, Raj?

04:41.694 --> 04:43.962
I don't recognize your edge.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.964
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

04:46.032 --> 04:48.634
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

04:48.701 --> 04:50.902
Well, you're in luck.

04:50.970 --> 04:54.106
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

04:55.708 --> 04:59.645
Oh, look, there's a sexually
attractive line segment.

04:59.712 --> 05:02.180
You should chat her up.

05:02.248 --> 05:03.682
What? Tell her you're a circle.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.351
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

05:09.122 --> 05:10.689
I hope you're hungry, Bernadette.

05:10.757 --> 05:12.324
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

05:12.392 --> 05:13.792
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.594
When you spend all day in a bio-lab,

05:15.662 --> 05:18.263
watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize small rodents,

05:18.331 --> 05:20.322
it really works up an appetite.

05:21.390 --> 05:23.324
Flesh-eating bacteria.

05:23.392 --> 05:25.326
And yet, I still want to kiss this woman.

05:25.394 --> 05:26.660
What does that tell you?

05:26.728 --> 05:28.662
That you'd be willing
to die a horrible death

05:28.730 --> 05:30.564
on the off-chance you'd get to second base?

05:31.767 --> 05:33.534
Oh, we're way past second base.

05:33.602 --> 05:34.869
Right, Howard?

05:34.936 --> 05:37.204
Well, we kind of disagree

05:37.272 --> 05:40.207
about what the bases are.

05:40.275 --> 05:42.109
How's your work going, Penny?

05:42.177 --> 05:43.611
Any acting jobs?

05:43.678 --> 05:45.780
Well, the last big thing
I did was this production

05:45.847 --> 05:48.182
<i>of Diary of Anne Frank above
a bowling alley.</i>

05:48.250 --> 05:51.752
But I think things might be
turning around pretty soon.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.854
Great. How come?

05:53.922 --> 05:56.056
Well, promise you won't make fun of me.

05:56.124 --> 05:58.492
Of course, I would never make fun of you.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.994
Okay.

06:00.061 --> 06:02.997
Well, I went to this psychic who
told me that if I cut my hair,

06:03.064 --> 06:05.065
I'm going to get a national commercial.

06:06.802 --> 06:08.436
Wh... Seriously?

06:08.503 --> 06:11.439
You're getting career advice from a psychic?

06:11.506 --> 06:14.875
Good job not making fun of her.

06:14.943 --> 06:17.044
She's not one of those phonies, okay.

06:17.112 --> 06:19.547
She wrote a book and has her own Web site.

06:19.614 --> 06:20.781
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

06:20.849 --> 06:23.217
They don't let just anyone have a Web site.

06:23.285 --> 06:25.719
Why are you being such a jerk?

06:25.787 --> 06:27.021
You're surprised?

06:27.088 --> 06:29.323
Your psychic tell you I
was going to be a jerk?

06:29.391 --> 06:31.592
Bite me.

06:33.128 --> 06:34.395
Come on, Penny.

06:34.463 --> 06:36.063
Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

06:36.131 --> 06:36.854
We're gonna make out back here.

06:41.592 --> 06:44.460
I'm sliding into third.

06:47.765 --> 06:48.966
Thanks for coming with me.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.300
Thanks for giving me

06:50.368 --> 06:52.503
<i>your limited edition Green Lantern
lantern.</i>

06:52.570 --> 06:55.105
Did you really have to bring it in with you?

06:55.173 --> 06:58.175
What if evil strikes and
my power ring runs low?

07:02.914 --> 07:04.848
Come on, let's get a drink. I don't drink.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.250
Yeah, well I do.

07:06.317 --> 07:08.519
<i>And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern,</i>

07:08.586 --> 07:10.120
I drink a lot.

07:10.188 --> 07:12.122
I'll have a screwdriver, please.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.525
Don't be chintzy with the screw.

07:14.592 --> 07:17.227
I would like a root beer float.

07:17.295 --> 07:20.197
Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.032
They don't?

07:22.100 --> 07:23.934
Well, apparently,
these people and I differ greatly

07:24.002 --> 07:25.969
on the definition of "party."

07:26.037 --> 07:28.305
He'll have a Shirley Temple.

07:28.373 --> 07:30.374
And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.546
Okay,

07:35.613 --> 07:37.214
let's check out the females.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.549
All right.

07:38.616 --> 07:40.484
There's a female.

07:40.552 --> 07:42.019
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.320
She's like 80 years old.

07:43.388 --> 07:45.155
But she's female.

07:45.223 --> 07:46.657
Isn't that the game? No.

07:46.724 --> 07:48.225
I'm looking for a hookup.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.060
Oh, yes.

07:50.128 --> 07:51.562
So, the point of this exercise is

07:51.629 --> 07:54.231
for you to find someone to copulate with?

07:54.299 --> 07:55.732
Not so loud,

07:55.800 --> 07:56.890
but ideally, yes.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.193
Thanks.

08:01.261 --> 08:02.995
Thank you.

08:03.063 --> 08:05.331
And what is my function as "wingman?"

08:05.399 --> 08:06.966
You help me run my game.

08:07.033 --> 08:08.000
Okay.

08:08.068 --> 08:11.537
What is your game?

08:11.605 --> 08:13.739
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,

08:13.807 --> 08:15.808
you nod and agree.

08:16.910 --> 08:18.377
Hey, that's pretty cool.

08:18.445 --> 08:19.512
What is it?

08:19.579 --> 08:21.013
It's a limited edition

08:21.081 --> 08:22.515
<i>Green Lantern lantern.</i>

08:22.582 --> 08:26.352
My friend is looking for
someone to copulate with.

08:26.420 --> 08:28.154
You're very funny.

08:28.221 --> 08:29.188
I'm Abby.

08:29.256 --> 08:31.190
I'm Sheldon. How do you do?

08:31.258 --> 08:33.192
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.860
Call me Raj. Hi, Raj.

08:34.928 --> 08:36.195
Where are you from?

08:36.263 --> 08:38.531
The mysterious subcontinent of India.

08:38.598 --> 08:39.865
Ooh, India.

08:39.933 --> 08:42.034
<i>You know India? I saw Slumdog
Millionaire.</i>

08:42.102 --> 08:44.770
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

08:46.873 --> 08:49.074
I thought your father was a gynecologist.

08:50.143 --> 08:51.444
I'm sorry.

08:55.182 --> 08:56.449
Martha, come here.

08:56.516 --> 08:57.783
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

08:57.851 --> 08:59.218
This is my friend, Martha. Hi.

08:59.286 --> 09:00.486
Hello. Hello.

09:00.554 --> 09:02.321
Is that the limited edition

09:02.389 --> 09:03.989
<i>Green Lantern lantern?</i>

09:04.057 --> 09:07.159
"In brightest day, in darkest night,

09:07.227 --> 09:09.228
no evil shall escape my sight."

09:11.865 --> 09:13.823
Oh, that is so awesome.

09:15.191 --> 09:16.424
Thank you.

09:16.492 --> 09:18.827
Have you chosen one to copulate with?

09:31.407 --> 09:35.076
So, what should we talk about?

09:36.245 --> 09:38.179
Well, we could always learn more

09:38.247 --> 09:40.548
about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots.

09:40.616 --> 09:41.883
Leonard?

09:45.221 --> 09:47.155
Oh, we don't need to
talk about that anymore.

09:47.223 --> 09:49.691
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.

09:49.759 --> 09:53.128
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

09:53.195 --> 09:54.829
Right, and if you can't understand it,

09:54.897 --> 09:56.464
it's not a fact.

09:56.532 --> 09:59.634
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

09:59.702 --> 10:00.635
Oh, got it.

10:00.703 --> 10:01.836
Thank you for educating me.

10:01.904 --> 10:05.106
You're welcome.

10:05.174 --> 10:06.241
How's your fish?

10:06.309 --> 10:07.242
Amazing.

10:07.310 --> 10:08.543
Would you like to try some?

10:08.611 --> 10:09.711
Yeah, sure. Well, the fact is,

10:09.779 --> 10:11.880
you can't.

10:11.948 --> 10:14.683
Come on, Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.017
Help me out here.

10:16.085 --> 10:17.419
What do you think-- want to jump

10:17.486 --> 10:18.687
right in the middle of
another couple's argument?

10:18.754 --> 10:19.688
No, thank you.

10:19.755 --> 10:21.056
Sorry.

10:22.258 --> 10:25.393
Maybe we should just
stop talking about this.

10:25.461 --> 10:28.396
Maybe some of us should
stop talking altogether.

10:28.464 --> 10:30.398
How is everything tonight?

10:30.466 --> 10:32.567
Really uncomfortable.

10:35.494 --> 10:37.195
You know, the best thing
about being in a committed,

10:37.263 --> 10:39.163
monogamous, mutually supportive relationship

10:39.231 --> 10:41.065
is that even if you have different ideas,

10:41.133 --> 10:43.701
you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for,

10:43.769 --> 10:45.937
even make love with...

10:47.973 --> 10:50.608
Want your fish?

10:53.946 --> 10:55.513
I knew you were going to do that.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.081
Doesn't make me psychic!

10:59.118 --> 11:02.453
Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.657
* American woman *

11:05.724 --> 11:09.761
* Listen what I say... *

11:10.796 --> 11:12.730
What's going on?

11:12.798 --> 11:15.600
We scored.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.803
I'm the wingman.

11:18.871 --> 11:21.205
* American woman. *

11:28.213 --> 11:29.014
Hey.

11:29.081 --> 11:31.683
Laser. Had a great night last night.

11:31.751 --> 11:33.852
I don't like to kiss and tell,

11:33.920 --> 11:36.922
but somebody made it to eighth base.

11:39.724 --> 11:42.092
What the hell is eighth base?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.195
Seventh base with shirt off.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.865
Well, my shirt.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.200
How'd things go

11:49.267 --> 11:50.201
with Penny?

11:50.268 --> 11:51.869
Oh... couldn't be better.

11:57.097 --> 11:57.830
Are we taking

11:57.898 --> 12:01.501
our relationship frustrations
out on innocent Cylons?

12:01.569 --> 12:02.802
It's not just Cylons.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.103
Superman's next.

12:05.839 --> 12:08.474
All right, I was going to try to squeeze in

12:08.542 --> 12:09.909
a little more mocking before lunch,

12:09.977 --> 12:11.144
but I can come back later

12:11.212 --> 12:13.780
when you don't have a high-powered weapon.

12:13.847 --> 12:17.917
How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

12:17.985 --> 12:19.686
Hey, I once dated a girl

12:19.753 --> 12:22.021
who believed she was abducted by aliens.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.523
And that didn't bother you?

12:23.591 --> 12:24.924
Au contraire.

12:24.992 --> 12:27.860
It meant she was gullible and
open to a little probing.

12:27.928 --> 12:30.163
What am I supposed to do,

12:30.231 --> 12:32.765
pretend I believe something I
don't whenever I'm with Penny?

12:32.833 --> 12:35.835
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things

12:35.903 --> 12:38.371
when she's with you.

12:38.439 --> 12:42.242
Do me a favor-- lean over,
put your head right here.

12:42.309 --> 12:45.311
Let me show you another way to look at this.

12:45.379 --> 12:49.315
Here we have the universe of all women.

12:49.383 --> 12:50.450
These are the ones

12:50.517 --> 12:51.818
you want to sleep with.

12:51.885 --> 12:54.954
These are the women who believe
exactly what you believe.

12:55.022 --> 12:57.690
These are the women who would
be willing to sleep with you.

12:59.693 --> 13:02.629
And right there in the
little triple intersection...

13:02.696 --> 13:04.063
is your ideal mate.

13:04.131 --> 13:07.000
Odds are she's a short
physicist with low self-esteem

13:07.067 --> 13:10.236
who lives in a government
research facility in China.

13:10.304 --> 13:12.572
What's your point?

13:12.640 --> 13:15.164
In order to keep having a
sexual relationship with Penny,

13:15.181 --> 13:17.082
I have to give up everything I believe in--

13:17.150 --> 13:18.817
my intellectual integrity, the very nature

13:18.885 --> 13:20.519
of who I am?

13:20.587 --> 13:22.588
I can't do that, Howard.

13:22.655 --> 13:24.456
I respect that.

13:27.327 --> 13:28.327
What is that?

13:28.394 --> 13:29.528
Your new girlfriend.

13:30.563 --> 13:32.064
Have fun tonight.

13:35.135 --> 13:37.703
The dog...

13:37.771 --> 13:40.806
<i>koira.</i>

13:40.874 --> 13:43.342
The roof...

13:43.409 --> 13:46.512
<i>katto.</i>

13:46.579 --> 13:50.249
Grapes...

13:55.255 --> 13:57.089
One minute.

14:01.194 --> 14:03.395
What was that?

14:03.463 --> 14:04.797
It means "come in."

14:04.864 --> 14:06.098
It's taking forever to load

14:06.166 --> 14:08.267
the new operating system on my computer.

14:08.334 --> 14:10.602
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,

14:10.670 --> 14:13.539
and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

14:16.543 --> 14:18.043
That's Hindi for

14:18.111 --> 14:19.711
"Whatever floats your boat."

14:19.779 --> 14:22.881
Uh, listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby,

14:22.949 --> 14:25.551
and she and her friend Martha
want to hang out with us again.

14:25.618 --> 14:26.552
What do you say?

14:26.619 --> 14:28.320
I don't say anything.

14:28.388 --> 14:30.022
I merely offer you a facial expression

14:30.089 --> 14:31.547
that suggests you've gone insane.

14:34.399 --> 14:34.999
I don't get it.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.074
You had a great time.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.276
Yes, exactly, I had a great time.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.378
That's done; I've moved on to other things.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.013
For example, after I learn Finnish,

14:42.081 --> 14:43.648
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.051
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy

14:47.119 --> 14:49.954
far from home, and I want a girlfriend

14:50.022 --> 14:51.389
and I want her to be Abby,

14:51.457 --> 14:53.291
and she'll only come over
if she can bring Martha.

14:53.359 --> 14:56.294
Raj, I highly doubt there is
any argument you can make,

14:56.362 --> 14:59.564
threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,

14:59.632 --> 15:01.165
plea, invocation,

15:01.233 --> 15:04.636
<i>supplication, or... vetoomus</i>

15:04.703 --> 15:09.407
that you can employ that would
convince me to reconsider.

15:22.588 --> 15:27.258
<i>My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan
Lee.</i>

15:28.260 --> 15:30.061
Oh, my.

15:47.746 --> 15:50.371
I've admired these for years.

15:51.439 --> 15:53.240
So does that mean we can
go with the girls again?

15:53.307 --> 15:57.410
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!

16:00.881 --> 16:03.183
You can't wear the hands on the date.

16:05.219 --> 16:08.488
Hulk sad.

16:10.825 --> 16:13.193
Hey.

16:14.162 --> 16:18.399
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

16:18.467 --> 16:19.900
Not only is it courteous,

16:19.968 --> 16:21.235
it's safety smart.

16:21.303 --> 16:23.271
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused

16:23.338 --> 16:27.208
by accidental dryer lint ignition.

16:27.276 --> 16:28.276
Now you're supposed to say,

16:28.343 --> 16:30.211
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

16:30.279 --> 16:32.313
"Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.

16:32.381 --> 16:34.415
I could never be mad at you."

16:34.483 --> 16:36.984
Wow, that's all you got

16:37.052 --> 16:38.786
after you were the most obnoxious person

16:38.854 --> 16:42.790
on a double date that
included Howard Wolowitz?

16:44.192 --> 16:45.593
No, I'm sorry.

16:45.661 --> 16:47.261
I really am. It's not right

16:47.329 --> 16:50.197
to mock what a person believes in.

16:50.265 --> 16:51.399
Thank you.

16:51.466 --> 16:53.267
Would you be willing to go to my psychic

16:53.335 --> 16:54.869
and see what it's all about?

16:54.936 --> 16:56.504
Would you be willing to read a book

16:56.571 --> 16:59.373
that concisely explains how
all psychics are frauds?

16:59.441 --> 17:01.742
I would not.

17:06.548 --> 17:08.939
Okay, let's go see your psychic.

17:09.007 --> 17:10.074
Really?

17:10.141 --> 17:12.576
Well, yeah, one of us has
to keep an open mind.

17:12.644 --> 17:13.844
You saying I don't have an open mind?

17:13.912 --> 17:15.746
No, n-not at all.
Let me help you with this stuff.

17:15.814 --> 17:19.450
You know, I believe in ghosts, too.

17:19.517 --> 17:21.151
Great. And astrology.

17:21.219 --> 17:25.155
I know, and pyramid power
and healing crystals.

17:25.223 --> 17:28.659
Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.

17:28.727 --> 17:31.662
Really, that's the line?

17:31.730 --> 17:34.331
Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?

17:34.399 --> 17:35.666
Oh, voodoo's real.

17:35.734 --> 17:38.168
You don't want to mess with voodoo.

17:41.005 --> 17:43.640
<i>Flatland is more than just a
mathematical essay.</i>

17:43.708 --> 17:46.843
It is also a treatise on
Victorian social mores.

17:46.911 --> 17:48.812
You know, I had never considered that.

17:52.617 --> 17:54.551
Wow, that's going to

17:54.619 --> 17:56.853
completely change my visits there.

18:05.863 --> 18:08.098
Well, it's late.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.299
Uh-huh.

18:09.367 --> 18:10.867
Time for bed.

18:10.935 --> 18:14.104
Okay.

18:15.139 --> 18:17.507
Good night, puny human!

18:28.573 --> 18:31.041
Sheldon?

18:37.414 --> 18:38.348
Yes?

18:38.416 --> 18:39.751
Listen, they're kind of

18:40.819 --> 18:42.743
getting busy in the living room, and...

18:42.761 --> 18:45.663
I was wondering if I could
hang out in here for a while.

18:47.698 --> 18:49.632
Well, I suppose.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.833
Come in.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.607
I'll sleep in Leonard's room. Good night.
