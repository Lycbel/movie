WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:03.001
Sheldon, you're wrong.

00:03.067 --> 00:06.134
Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
Howard,

00:06.201 --> 00:07.834
you know me to be
a very smart man.

00:07.867 --> 00:11.834
Don't you think
if I were wrong, I'd know it?

00:11.900 --> 00:13.734
Okay, first of all...
Give it up, dude.

00:13.767 --> 00:16.267
You're arguing
with a crazy person.

00:16.334 --> 00:17.667
I'm not crazy.

00:17.734 --> 00:19.267
My mother had me tested.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.667
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

00:22.734 --> 00:24.567
What do you mean?
It's new comic book night.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.567
Yeah, but since you and Penny
finally hooked up, we thought

00:26.600 --> 00:30.234
you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-y night.

00:30.301 --> 00:33.067
There's more to life
than sex, Raj.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.267
Okay, who had "Leonard flames out
with Penny in less than 24 hours"?

00:35.334 --> 00:37.468
I did.

00:37.533 --> 00:39.134
Nothing flamed out.

00:39.201 --> 00:41.134
We don't have to have sex
every night, you know.

00:41.201 --> 00:45.134
You don't have to,
but it's highly recommended.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.468
Yeah, take advantage
of that window of opportunity

00:47.567 --> 00:50.600
before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.667
It's not a matter
of opportunity.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.001
We're getting to know
each other.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.600
There's a learning curve.

00:55.633 --> 00:56.700
What's there to learn?

00:56.767 --> 00:58.267
You get naked, do nasty
things to each other,

00:58.301 --> 01:00.134
then somebody makes
scrambled eggs and salami.

01:00.201 --> 01:01.368
Easy peasy.

01:01.434 --> 01:02.700
Perhaps what Leonard

01:02.767 --> 01:04.334
is oblique referring to

01:04.434 --> 01:06.767
is the occurrence of some sort
of sexual dysfunction.

01:06.834 --> 01:10.267
Okay, who had
"Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

01:10.301 --> 01:12.800
Oh, a clever--
albeit obsolete, euphemism

01:12.867 --> 01:15.334
for insufficient blood flow to
the male sex organ.

01:15.401 --> 01:17.667
(singsongy chuckle)

01:17.734 --> 01:19.700
Nothing like that happened,
all right?

01:19.767 --> 01:21.834
The sex was... just fine.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.867
Just fine?

01:23.934 --> 01:28.001
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry
Potter movie was "just fine."

01:28.067 --> 01:29.967
I'm not saying it was bad.

01:30.001 --> 01:32.633
I'm just saying it...
wasn't great.

01:32.667 --> 01:33.767
Okay, when you say
"it wasn'great,"

01:33.800 --> 01:35.034
do you mean for both of you?

01:35.101 --> 01:37.034
Because we can totally see
it not being great for her.

01:37.101 --> 01:38.567
Am I right?
Oh, yeah.

01:38.633 --> 01:41.234
To tell you the truth,
I think we were both a little--

01:41.301 --> 01:42.301
I don't know...

01:42.368 --> 01:43.700
Disappointed? Let down?

01:43.767 --> 01:45.767
Ashamed? Horrified?
Repulsed?

01:45.834 --> 01:49.034
All I know is, it wasn't the way
I dreamed it would be.

01:49.101 --> 01:53.834
Sex is never the way
I dream it's gonna be.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.001
That's because
in your dreams,

01:56.067 --> 01:58.600
you're a horse
from the waist down.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.533
<i>Excuse me,
Wolverine: Origin.</i>

02:02.600 --> 02:05.567
Miniseries issue two, page2.

02:05.633 --> 02:07.500
Retractable bone claws.

02:07.567 --> 02:09.834
If you people spent less time
thinking about sex

02:09.900 --> 02:11.734
and more time concentrating
on comic books,

02:11.800 --> 02:13.934
we'd have far fewer of these
embarrassing moments.

02:16.301 --> 02:19.633
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

02:19.734 --> 02:23.101
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

02:23.134 --> 02:24.667
* The Earth began to cool

02:24.734 --> 02:27.900
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developedools *

02:27.967 --> 02:30.067
<i>* We built the Wall
* We built the pyramids *</i>

02:30.134 --> 02:32.600
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

02:32.667 --> 02:34.167
* That all started
with a big ban*

02:42.964 --> 02:44.631
Sheldon, dinner's here.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.564
Tandoori Palace?

02:46.598 --> 02:48.164
No, we went somewhere new.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.431
You're good naturedly
ribbing me, aren't you?

02:54.497 --> 02:56.564
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

02:56.598 --> 02:57.357
Why?

02:57.363 --> 02:59.031
Why would we change?

02:59.098 --> 03:00.030
We had a perfectly good palace.

03:00.064 --> 03:02.997
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

03:03.064 --> 03:04.631
Trust me, this will be
just fine.

03:04.698 --> 03:05.631
(scoffs)

03:05.698 --> 03:06.863
<i>You are the authority</i>

03:06.897 --> 03:09.797
on "just fine."

03:11.798 --> 03:12.798
What's that supposed to mean?

03:13.698 --> 03:15.598
What's "Not bad, but not great"?

03:15.664 --> 03:16.830
(stifled chuckles)

03:17.964 --> 03:19.598
What are they talking about?

03:19.664 --> 03:21.364
I don't know.
I know.

03:21.431 --> 03:22.464
As I'm sure you're aware...
Duh-duh-duh-duh-

03:22.531 --> 03:24.064
duh-duh.

03:24.130 --> 03:26.930
If that's Morse code,
that's terrible.

03:28.264 --> 03:29.598
As I was saying,
you and Leonard had

03:29.664 --> 03:31.097
a disappointing
sexual encounter.

03:31.164 --> 03:32.231
Earlier this evening,

03:32.264 --> 03:34.397
Leonard characterized it
as "just fine."

03:34.464 --> 03:35.863
So what you're seeing
here is a continuation

03:35.897 --> 03:38.097
of the mocking that followed.

03:40.830 --> 03:41.930
Okay, yeah, well,

03:41.997 --> 03:43.631
I'm just gonna go
eat my dinner elsewhe.

03:43.698 --> 03:45.797
Maybe an airplane
headed for a mountainside.

03:47.231 --> 03:48.863
Penny, wait.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.331
Aah!

03:50.397 --> 03:52.830
What is wrong with you?

03:52.897 --> 03:56.097
(door slams)

03:56.130 --> 03:59.631
I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.164
Yeah, you...
No, don't tell him.

04:02.231 --> 04:05.397
Let's see if he can
figure it out.

04:09.664 --> 04:11.930
Ugh, I am so embarrassed!

04:11.997 --> 04:13.130
Please don't be mad

04:13.197 --> 04:14.397
What did you tell them?

04:14.464 --> 04:17.231
Nothing bad, just that last night
was fine.

04:17.297 --> 04:19.631
Fine? You said it was fine?

04:19.698 --> 04:21.830
Yeah, it's a perfectly
good word.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.664
You put it in front
of "wine" or "dining,"

04:23.730 --> 04:26.064
and you've really got something.

04:29.297 --> 04:32.431
Okay, well, let me ask you this:

04:32.497 --> 04:34.164
How was last night for you?

04:34.231 --> 04:37.997
It was... okay.

04:38.064 --> 04:39.964
Okay.

04:39.997 --> 04:42.431
Yeah, it's a perfectly
good word.

04:42.497 --> 04:44.464
I mean, you put it in front of "dokay"

04:44.497 --> 04:46.297
you really got something.

04:48.064 --> 04:49.164
All right, look,
let's not overreact, you know

04:49.197 --> 04:50.598
For a lot of couples,
it takes time

04:50.664 --> 04:52.197
to get to know
each other's rhythms.

04:52.264 --> 04:54.331
Learn what the other person
was and likes.

04:54.364 --> 04:56.297
So, you've been
through this before?

04:56.364 --> 04:57.664
No.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.464
Okay-dokay.

05:02.997 --> 05:05.331
You know, I think this is
one of those things where

05:05.364 --> 05:06.897
talking about it is not
going to make it better.

05:06.964 --> 05:07.997
Want a glass of wine?

05:08.064 --> 05:10.297
So much.
Okay

05:10.331 --> 05:12.164
See, we should've
do this last night.

05:12.197 --> 05:15.097
You know, have a little wine,
take the edge off.

05:15.164 --> 05:17.897
Actually, ethyl alcohol
inhibits electrical conduction

05:17.997 --> 05:20.763
in the nerve cells and
stimulates reuptake receptors

05:20.830 --> 05:26.030
of inhibitory neurotramitters
like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

05:28.097 --> 05:30.964
Don't talk, just drink.

05:34.297 --> 05:35.997
No, you're misunderstanding.

05:36.030 --> 05:39.397
A shiksa goddess
isn't an actual goddess.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.064
<i>And we don't pray to them.</i>

05:42.130 --> 05:44.698
<i>We prey on them.</i>

05:44.730 --> 05:46.231
Whatever, dude.

05:46.331 --> 05:49.030
The point is, Leonard's
got one and you don't.

05:49.097 --> 05:51.064
Is this it?

05:51.130 --> 05:53.997
It was inappropriate to discuss
Leonard and Penny's sex life

05:54.030 --> 05:55.497
in front of Leonard and Penny.

05:55.564 --> 05:59.030
Oh, good!

05:59.064 --> 06:00.231
(sighs with relief)

06:00.297 --> 06:01.763
Now I can eat.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.064
(cricket chirping)

06:08.130 --> 06:09.964
What's that?

06:10.030 --> 06:12.464
Sounds like a cricket.
Hang on.

06:12.531 --> 06:16.863
(cricket chirping)

06:16.897 --> 06:18.564
Based on the number
of chirps per minute

06:18.598 --> 06:19.997
and the ambient temperature
in this room,

06:20.064 --> 06:23.097
it is a snowy tree cricket.

06:23.164 --> 06:25.598
Oh, give me a freakin' break.

06:25.664 --> 06:27.897
How would you
possibly know that?

06:27.964 --> 06:29.464
In 1890, Emile Dolbear

06:29.531 --> 06:30.664
determined that there was

06:30.730 --> 06:31.897
a fixed relationship
between the number

06:31.930 --> 06:33.698
ofhirps per minute
of the snowy tree cricket

06:33.730 --> 06:35.164
and the ambient temperature.

06:35.231 --> 06:36.830
A precise relationship
that is not preesent

06:36.897 --> 06:38.830
with ordinary field crickets.

06:38.897 --> 06:41.331
How do you know what the exact
temperature of the room is?

06:41.397 --> 06:43.264
Under the terms of my roommate
agreement with Leonard,

06:43.297 --> 06:44.897
I've had unilateral control
of the thermostat

06:44.930 --> 06:47.964
ever since the sweaty night
of '06.

06:48.030 --> 06:51.797
Ok, you were right about
wolverine and bone claws,

06:51.863 --> 06:54.930
but you're wrong
about the cricket.

06:54.964 --> 06:56.231
Howard, don't embarrass
yourself.

06:56.264 --> 06:58.397
The science chirps for itself.

06:58.431 --> 07:02.264
(chuckling):
Humorous word play.

07:02.331 --> 07:03.897
No, no, not this time.

07:03.930 --> 07:05.130
I know insects, my friend.

07:05.197 --> 07:06.830
I spent nearly all my

07:06.897 --> 07:08.331
childhood years
capturing them with nets,

07:08.397 --> 07:10.331
putting them in glass jars,
sticking pins through them,

07:10.397 --> 07:12.664
mounting them on corrugated
cardboard with Dymo labels

07:12.730 --> 07:16.231
underneath, identifying
the genus and species.

07:16.297 --> 07:18.464
In Latin.

07:20.297 --> 07:23.664
Oh, dude, you are never
getting a shiksa goddess.

07:24.664 --> 07:26.964
(cricket chirping)

07:26.997 --> 07:28.863
<i>That is a snowy tree cricket.</i>

07:28.930 --> 07:30.497
<i>Oecanthus fultoni.</i>

07:30.564 --> 07:33.797
I was done with Latin
by fifth grade.

07:33.863 --> 07:35.364
Okay, okay, tell you what.

07:35.431 --> 07:37.364
I am willing to bet anything

07:37.431 --> 07:38.631
that's an ordinary
field cricket.

07:38.698 --> 07:40.698
I can't take your money.

07:40.763 --> 07:42.397
What's the matter, you chicken?

07:42.464 --> 07:45.297
I've always found that
an inappropriate slur.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.698
Chickens are not by nature,

07:46.797 --> 07:47.897
at all timid.

07:47.964 --> 07:49.397
In fact, when I was young,

07:49.464 --> 07:50.797
my neighbor's chicken got loose

07:50.830 --> 07:53.763
and chased me up the big elm
tree in front of our house.

07:55.598 --> 07:57.231
Chickens can't climb trees.

07:57.297 --> 07:58.631
Thank God.

08:00.930 --> 08:02.030
Okay,

08:02.097 --> 08:04.064
I believe a chicken
made you his bitch.

08:05.531 --> 08:07.197
But the cricket thing,
I don't buy.

08:07.264 --> 08:08.364
Bet it.

08:08.431 --> 08:10.797
Fair enough.

08:10.863 --> 08:13.130
What stakes do you propose?

08:13.729 --> 08:16.639
I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48

08:16.830 --> 08:18.730
first appearance of Silver Surfer,

08:18.797 --> 08:21.064
against your Flash 123,

08:21.097 --> 08:22.863
the classic Flash
of two worlds issue.

08:22.930 --> 08:25.997
All right, you have a wager.

08:26.064 --> 08:28.631
Hmm.
Great.

08:28.698 --> 08:30.130
Now how are you going to
settle it, hmm?

08:30.197 --> 08:31.763
There is no way
to determine the species

08:31.830 --> 08:33.598
of the cricket
without examining it.

08:33.664 --> 08:38.464
(cricket chirping)

08:38.531 --> 08:41.897
(chirping continues)

08:41.930 --> 08:45.730
I wonder what the non-pathetic
people are doing tonight.

08:45.797 --> 08:48.064
(cricket chirping)

08:58.130 --> 08:59.997
More wine?
Hit me.

09:06.364 --> 09:07.631
I don't see anything.

09:07.698 --> 09:10.064
Shh!

09:10.097 --> 09:13.997
(cricket chirping)

09:14.064 --> 09:15.531
Hallway.

09:19.231 --> 09:20.431
(groaning)

09:20.497 --> 09:22.497
One at a time.

09:30.097 --> 09:31.930
(deep growling)

09:34.097 --> 09:35.497
What was that?

09:35.564 --> 09:38.397
My stomach.

09:38.431 --> 09:40.431
Indian food doesn't
agree with me.

09:42.497 --> 09:44.830
Ironic, isn't it?

09:44.897 --> 09:47.397
Shh!

09:47.431 --> 09:48.730
(chirpinresumes)

09:48.763 --> 09:51.130
(whispering):
Elevator shaft.

09:51.930 --> 09:54.863
(chirping)

09:54.930 --> 09:56.464
Help me open it.

09:56.531 --> 09:57.698
Are you crazy?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.997
We can't go down an empty
elevator shaft.

10:00.064 --> 10:01.930
Fine, if you don't
want to proceed,

10:01.964 --> 10:03.130
then you forfeit the bet,

10:03.164 --> 10:05.130
and I'll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.

10:06.164 --> 10:07.497
Let's open her up.

10:09.598 --> 10:12.497
Are you bothered that I can
so easily manipulate you?

10:12.564 --> 10:13.997
Don't push me, Sheldon.

10:14.064 --> 10:17.631
I may be small, but I took
kung fu when I was 13,

10:17.664 --> 10:20.164
and I remember
a good deal of it.

10:20.231 --> 10:21.364
Oh, really?

10:21.431 --> 10:23.097
Well, I grew up
with an older brother

10:23.130 --> 10:24.964
and a very contentious
twin sister.

10:24.997 --> 10:26.698
And I believe I could
easily best you

10:26.763 --> 10:29.297
in any physical confrontation--
be it noogies, swirlies

10:29.297 --> 10:31.763
or the classic
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

10:33.531 --> 10:38.097
Ooh, big talk from a man who
was once treed by a chicken.

10:41.664 --> 10:43.664
(both chuckle)

10:46.997 --> 10:48.997
What are we drinking now?

10:49.064 --> 10:51.030
Peppermint schnapps.

10:52.264 --> 10:55.164
Why would you buy
peppermint schnapps?

10:55.231 --> 10:57.164
Because I like peppermint,

10:57.197 --> 11:00.197
and it's fun to say schnapps.

11:00.264 --> 11:02.997
(both laugh)

11:03.030 --> 11:05.030
Hey, Leonard?
What?

11:05.097 --> 11:07.531
Schnapps.

11:07.598 --> 11:09.564
Schnapps.

11:09.631 --> 11:11.631
You're right,
that is fun.

11:14.197 --> 11:16.631
Be careful.

11:16.698 --> 11:18.631
If I were not being careful,

11:18.698 --> 11:21.464
your telling me to be careful
would not make me careful.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.030
(cricket chirping)

11:26.364 --> 11:28.464
Stairwell.

11:28.531 --> 11:30.464
Uh-oh, flashlight went out.

11:30.531 --> 11:32.964
I need some batteries.

11:33.030 --> 11:35.030
Fellas?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.997
Hello?

11:40.897 --> 11:43.897
It's really dark down here.

11:45.231 --> 11:47.197
(vomiting)

11:47.231 --> 11:50.030
Oh, sweetie.

11:50.064 --> 11:53.064
You really can't hold
your liquor, can you?

11:54.164 --> 11:55.763
I'm okay.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.097
Just a little mouthwash,

11:57.164 --> 12:00.730
and then I'm gonna rock
your world.

12:04.030 --> 12:05.964
(vomiting)

12:06.030 --> 12:07.763
Are you okay?

12:07.830 --> 12:08.930
(vomiting)

12:15.730 --> 12:18.663
Ugh, Toby, what did you do
in a past life

12:18.730 --> 12:21.564
to be so disgusting now?

12:21.630 --> 12:22.830
His name isn't Toby.

12:22.897 --> 12:25.131
Toby is an absurd name
for a cricket.

12:25.197 --> 12:26.231
What would you name him?

12:26.297 --> 12:27.897
An appropriate cricket name.

12:27.930 --> 12:30.264
For example, Jiminy.

12:30.331 --> 12:31.564
All right,

12:31.630 --> 12:33.030
Sheldon, here we go.

12:33.064 --> 12:35.564
<i>Kleingast's Field Guide
to North American Insects.</i>

12:35.630 --> 12:37.264
He's Toby.

12:37.331 --> 12:39.797
Right here.

12:39.864 --> 12:40.830
See it?

12:40.897 --> 12:41.864
The common field cricket,

12:41.930 --> 12:43.030
<i>AK Gryllus assimilis,</i>

12:43.097 --> 12:45.564
which is Latin
for "suck it, you lose."

12:45.598 --> 12:47.630
Hang on.

12:49.297 --> 12:50.864
The snowy tree cricket.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.864
<i>AKA Oecanthus fultoni,</i>

12:52.930 --> 12:55.097
which is Latin for
I'll suck nothing.

12:55.164 --> 12:56.364
Of course I'm joking

12:56.431 --> 12:59.097
<i>because the Latin for that
is nihil exsorbibo.</i>

12:59.164 --> 13:01.598
That is not Toby,

13:01.663 --> 13:02.697
this is Toby.

13:02.763 --> 13:04.431
Raj, what do
you think?

13:04.464 --> 13:07.297
Oh, I really don't care anymore.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.397
God, I had the most
horrible night.

13:12.763 --> 13:15.763
Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the shiksi goddess.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.531
Shiksa. Shik-sa.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.697
Forgive me.

13:19.763 --> 13:22.697
Yiddish was not spoken
in East Texas.

13:22.763 --> 13:26.030
And if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.197
Yeah, fine, whatever.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.231
The point is,
you're wrong again.

13:29.297 --> 13:31.697
We haven't established that I'm wrong once.
All right.

13:31.763 --> 13:32.930
Tell you what.
Let's go down

13:32.964 --> 13:34.431
to the Entomology
Department

13:34.464 --> 13:35.763
and let Professor
Crawley tell us

13:35.797 --> 13:37.663
what kind of cricket
Toby is.

13:37.730 --> 13:38.930
He's a snowy
treericket,

13:38.997 --> 13:40.630
and his name
is Jiminy.

13:40.697 --> 13:43.598
I bet I could throw
a rock in this room

13:43.663 --> 13:46.164
and come up
with three better friends.

13:53.164 --> 13:55.964
Holy crap.

14:00.064 --> 14:03.064
<i>It's like Silence
of the Lambs down here.</i>

14:04.630 --> 14:05.630
(screams)

14:07.598 --> 14:09.830
Don't do that!

14:09.897 --> 14:11.830
You're such a girl.

14:11.897 --> 14:12.930
They're just bugs.

14:12.964 --> 14:14.364
Yeah, well,
I don't like bugs, okay?

14:14.431 --> 14:15.498
They freak me out.

14:15.598 --> 14:16.864
Interesting.

14:16.930 --> 14:19.231
You're afraid of
insects and women.

14:19.297 --> 14:22.763
Ladybugs must render
you catatonic.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.197
It was a joke.

14:27.264 --> 14:29.864
I made it to lessen
your discomfort.

14:30.897 --> 14:32.431
You're welcome.

14:32.498 --> 14:34.164
(footsteps)

14:37.598 --> 14:39.030
(chuckling): Don't knock.

14:39.097 --> 14:40.297
Just walk in.

14:40.331 --> 14:42.997
Why be polite to the world's
leading expert

14:43.030 --> 14:45.030
on the dung beetle?

14:45.097 --> 14:46.697
Excuse me,

14:46.763 --> 14:48.431
are you Professor Crawley?

14:48.498 --> 14:50.531
Who wants to know?

14:50.598 --> 14:54.030
I'm Dr. Cooper
from the Physics Department.

14:54.097 --> 14:55.697
Couldn't wait, huh?

14:55.697 --> 14:56.763
I'm sorry?

14:56.830 --> 14:58.231
I haven't even packed yet,

14:58.264 --> 15:00.297
and you're already
measuring my lab

15:00.364 --> 15:04.598
for one of your godless
laser machines.

15:04.663 --> 15:06.663
No, you don't understand.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.264
We just want to ask you
a question.

15:08.297 --> 15:11.264
Let me ask you one first.

15:11.297 --> 15:13.297
What's a world renowned
entomologist

15:13.364 --> 15:14.964
with a doctorate

15:15.030 --> 15:17.531
and 20 years of experience
to do with his life

15:17.598 --> 15:21.030
when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

15:21.097 --> 15:23.064
Ask rhetorical questions

15:23.097 --> 15:25.730
that make people
uncomfortable?

15:25.797 --> 15:27.997
(sarcastic laugh)

15:28.064 --> 15:30.431
What's your deal?

15:30.464 --> 15:34.131
Are they planning to outsource
my job to Bangalore?

15:35.464 --> 15:38.164
I'm from New Delhi.

15:38.231 --> 15:40.164
Maybe you should find
another entomologist.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.930
No, no. We're here.
Let's settle this.

15:41.964 --> 15:44.763
Professor, can you identify
our cricket?

15:44.830 --> 15:46.197
Of course I can.

15:46.264 --> 15:49.864
I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

15:49.930 --> 15:51.331
Not that
that's going

15:51.397 --> 15:54.663
to keep me from having to move
in with my daughter in Oxnard.

15:54.730 --> 15:56.164
And we're not talking

15:56.231 --> 15:58.697
Oxnard at the beach. No!

15:58.763 --> 15:59.964
We're talking
Oxnard

16:00.030 --> 16:02.997
in the onion fields.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.231
Well, could you
look at Toby?

16:08.297 --> 16:09.730
Toby?

16:11.498 --> 16:13.797
What a stupid name
for a cricket.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.797
Told ya.

16:16.864 --> 16:18.498
It's a field cricket.

16:18.564 --> 16:19.730
Yes!
No, no, wait.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.730
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

16:21.730 --> 16:24.097
Young man, I've been
studying insects

16:24.131 --> 16:25.464
since I was eight years old.

16:25.498 --> 16:27.331
You know what
they used to call me

16:27.397 --> 16:28.364
in school?

16:28.431 --> 16:30.397
Creepy Crawley.

16:30.464 --> 16:32.297
Cruel as that may be,

16:32.331 --> 16:34.397
that is not in itself
a credential.

16:35.431 --> 16:37.697
Let me show you something.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.364
See that?

16:39.431 --> 16:41.531
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

16:41.598 --> 16:44.164
I discovered it after spending
six months slogging

16:44.197 --> 16:46.197
through a Bornean rain forest,

16:46.264 --> 16:48.730
while my wife
was back home

16:48.797 --> 16:51.397
shacking up with a two-bit
ornithologist

16:51.464 --> 16:53.397
who lives on a sailboat

16:53.464 --> 16:56.164
and likes to wear
boot-cut jeans!

16:56.231 --> 16:58.364
So, when I tell

16:58.431 --> 17:01.763
you that that's a common
field cricket,

17:01.763 --> 17:04.331
you can take that
to the damn bank!

17:04.397 --> 17:06.131
'Cause God knows
I can't!

17:06.197 --> 17:08.930
That tramp took me
for everything!

17:14.097 --> 17:17.064
Well, apparently,
I was wrong.

17:17.131 --> 17:19.131
Congratulations.

17:25.598 --> 17:27.197
Enjoy Oxnard.

17:28.997 --> 17:31.598
I'm sure your daughter's looking
forward to having you.

17:38.564 --> 17:40.030
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

17:40.064 --> 17:41.864
What you got there?
new comic book?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.997
Old comic book.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.997
I just retrieved it
from my safe deposit box.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.030
What do you have a safe
deposit box for?

17:50.097 --> 17:53.030
Old comic books.

17:53.064 --> 17:55.197
I lost this
to Wollowitz

17:55.231 --> 17:58.197
in an ill-considered
cricket wager.

17:58.231 --> 18:00.897
What, do they have
Wii cricket now?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.397
That can't be very popular.

18:04.464 --> 18:06.598
Penny, I'd rather
not talk about it.

18:06.663 --> 18:08.264
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

18:08.331 --> 18:09.763
I'm not feeling so hot either.

18:10.864 --> 18:13.397
Why would that make
me feel better?

18:13.464 --> 18:15.964
I don't know, empathy?

18:20.264 --> 18:22.064
Anyway, I'm just saying,

18:22.097 --> 18:24.064
that you're feeling upset
about something with Howard,

18:24.097 --> 18:25.897
and I'm upset about something
with Leonard.
Yes,

18:25.964 --> 18:28.097
yes, the disappointing sex.

18:29.164 --> 18:30.763
That's an inexact
parallel.

18:30.830 --> 18:33.397
You and Leonard can always
return to being friends,

18:33.464 --> 18:34.930
whereas I can never
return to a state

18:34.997 --> 18:37.064
in which Wolowitz
has not bested me

18:37.097 --> 18:39.763
like Mrs. Riley's
chicken.

18:39.797 --> 18:41.897
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

18:41.964 --> 18:44.964
A chicken that was owned
by MrsRiley.

18:46.164 --> 18:47.864
Okay, forget the chicken.

18:47.864 --> 18:50.264
Well, I wish I could.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.864
No, no.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.697
You may be right
about me and Leonard.

18:53.763 --> 18:55.030
Of course I'm right.

18:55.097 --> 18:57.864
What are the odds I'd be
wrong twice in one week?

18:57.930 --> 19:00.231
No, I mean, we can always go
back to being friends.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.331
I just said that.

19:02.364 --> 19:03.797
This conversation has
started to circle.

19:04.264 --> 19:05.531
Hello. Meeting adjourned.

19:10.598 --> 19:11.897
Hey.

19:11.897 --> 19:14.331
What's going on?

19:14.397 --> 19:15.830
Oh, you'd like
to catch up

19:15.930 --> 19:17.531
on the events of the
day. All right.

19:17.598 --> 19:20.064
Well, there was a half-hour wait
at the bank

19:20.131 --> 19:21.663
to get into my safe deposit box,

19:21.697 --> 19:24.364
I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems,

19:24.431 --> 19:25.830
and, oh, yes,

19:25.864 --> 19:27.830
in a moment filled
with biblical resonance,

19:27.864 --> 19:29.897
pride wenteth before my fall,

19:29.897 --> 19:33.697
<i>causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.</i>

19:33.763 --> 19:34.930
Wait a minute.

19:34.997 --> 19:37.498
You talked to Penny
about our sex life?

19:37.564 --> 19:39.331
Leonard, it astonishes me

19:39.397 --> 19:41.331
how you continually fixate
on the trivial.

19:41.397 --> 19:44.131
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

19:44.164 --> 19:45.464
Right, right.

19:45.498 --> 19:47.064
You're saying you talked
to Penny?

19:47.131 --> 19:48.397
Ye-Yes.

19:48.464 --> 19:49.131
Interesting.

19:49.164 --> 19:50.964
Hardly.

19:51.030 --> 19:52.097
Excuse me.

19:52.131 --> 19:54.564
Have I crossed some
sort of line again?

19:54.630 --> 19:56.598
Little bit.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.663
Hmm.

20:03.664 --> 20:04.664
Oh, who cares?

20:11.530 --> 20:12.064
Oh, hey.
Hey.

20:12.130 --> 20:13.797
Uh, what did Sheldon
say to you?

20:13.864 --> 20:14.831
Not a lot.

20:14.897 --> 20:16.497
Just that we always
have the option

20:16.597 --> 20:18.230
of going back
to being friends.

20:18.297 --> 20:20.397
Is that what you want?

20:20.464 --> 20:21.697
I don't know.

20:21.731 --> 20:23.364
I mean, you have to admit

20:23.397 --> 20:26.098
things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

20:26.163 --> 20:27.964
I guess.

20:28.031 --> 20:29.597
It would take
the pressure off.

20:29.664 --> 20:31.897
It would, wouldn't it?

20:32.897 --> 20:35.098
So, we'll just be friends.

20:35.163 --> 20:36.263
Good.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.697
Good.

20:37.764 --> 20:39.697
