WEBVTT

00:02.256 --> 00:03.795
Check this out.

00:08.657 --> 00:10.343
Leonard, she's doing it again.

00:11.319 --> 00:13.971
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

00:15.192 --> 00:17.318
It upsets Sheldon
when she willy-nilly takes it

00:17.443 --> 00:20.353
from the containers without regard
for its equitable distribution.

00:21.503 --> 00:24.042
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

00:26.664 --> 00:28.406
You want me to put it back?

00:30.907 --> 00:33.538
It upsets Sheldon
when you play with the Sheldon.

00:36.382 --> 00:38.036
What's up, my nerd dizzles?

00:40.582 --> 00:42.375
I want you to meet
my girlfriend Bernadette.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.127
You know my girlfriend Bernadette.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.396
Say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.154
I don't think I can.

00:52.535 --> 00:54.412
I don't have Howard's street cred.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.550
I told my girlfriend Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

00:59.675 --> 01:03.068
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- Wa... no, that's a false equivalency.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.647
More does not equal merry.

01:04.816 --> 01:07.012
If there were 2,000 people
in this apartment right now,

01:07.137 --> 01:09.735
would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating.

01:11.031 --> 01:13.238
Don't "Sheldon" me.
We ordered for five people, not six.

01:13.408 --> 01:16.404
It's fine. We'll just put it all
on the table, you know, family style.

01:16.529 --> 01:19.313
Sure. And while we're at it, why don't
we put our hands behind our backs,

01:19.438 --> 01:21.789
have an old-fashioned
eating contest?

01:22.503 --> 01:24.208
Relax, it'll be fine.
Sit down, you guys.

01:27.835 --> 01:28.555
What?!

01:30.868 --> 01:32.425
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

01:32.594 --> 01:34.886
- Why not?
- That's where Sheldon sits.

01:35.077 --> 01:36.387
He can't sit somewhere else?

01:38.141 --> 01:39.379
In the winter,

01:39.504 --> 01:41.844
that seat is close enough
to the radiator so that he's warm,

01:41.969 --> 01:43.394
yet not so close that he sweats.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.830
In the summer, it's directly
in the path of a cross-breeze

01:45.955 --> 01:47.803
created by
opening windows there and there.

01:47.928 --> 01:50.020
It faces the television
at an angle that isn't direct,

01:50.145 --> 01:51.489
so he can talk to everybody,

01:51.614 --> 01:54.107
yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

01:58.383 --> 02:00.582
Perhaps there's hope
for you after all.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.138
Episode 310:
The Gorilla Experiment

02:06.852 --> 02:08.096
Sync: Jess, Lin

02:23.018 --> 02:25.517
www.subbercafe.fr

02:28.463 --> 02:29.527
I love your shoes.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.440
Oh, thanks.
They are cute, aren't they?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.361
Where'd you get them?
Shoes for Less.

02:33.540 --> 02:37.226
- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

02:38.403 --> 02:40.387
My mother was right.
Hell is real.

02:42.276 --> 02:45.040
Come on, Sheldon.
Let the womenfolk chat.

02:48.153 --> 02:48.960
Womenfolk?

02:49.905 --> 02:51.185
Gals?
Chicks?

02:51.846 --> 02:53.123
Utero-Americans?

02:55.525 --> 02:56.927
Just eat your dinner.

02:57.096 --> 02:58.711
Don't take him too seriously.

02:58.836 --> 03:01.239
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

03:02.902 --> 03:04.684
I don't think it's very funny.

03:05.127 --> 03:07.710
Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.804
Never let her go.

03:15.338 --> 03:18.864
Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

03:19.359 --> 03:21.408
I am.
Are you interested in physics?

03:21.577 --> 03:22.786
I find it fascinating.

03:23.314 --> 03:25.021
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,

03:25.146 --> 03:27.284
I probably would have
gone into physics.

03:27.409 --> 03:28.611
Or ice dancing.

03:30.337 --> 03:32.018
Actually, my tests
of the Aharonov-Bohm

03:32.143 --> 03:34.525
quantum interference effect
have reached an interesting point.

03:34.650 --> 03:37.466
Right now, we're testing the phase
shift due to an electric potential.

03:37.635 --> 03:38.593
That's amazing.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.691
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

03:41.816 --> 03:45.045
as third graders growing
lima beans in wet paper towels.

03:47.089 --> 03:49.354
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

03:49.523 --> 03:52.207
I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

03:56.660 --> 03:59.531
Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

04:00.650 --> 04:01.730
Yes, I am.

04:01.855 --> 04:03.618
You want to see a simulation
on my laptop?

04:03.861 --> 04:05.161
Oh, yeah, show me.

04:05.775 --> 04:09.204
In microbiology, the most exciting
thing I get to work with is yeast.

04:12.754 --> 04:14.367
Your shoes are delightful.

04:18.029 --> 04:19.425
Where did you get them?

04:20.630 --> 04:22.877
- What?
- Bazinga. I don't care.

04:31.589 --> 04:32.772
Eat my dust,

04:32.962 --> 04:34.841
racially stereotypical plumber.

04:38.838 --> 04:41.239
That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.

04:41.587 --> 04:43.158
And a cow and a penguin.

04:44.323 --> 04:45.076
Face it,

04:45.276 --> 04:47.831
dude, whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car,

04:47.956 --> 04:49.082
you can't drive.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.623
Just need a little more practice.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.962
What you need is cheat codes,
motor skills and a magic genie

04:55.087 --> 04:58.162
who grants wishes to little boys
who suck at Mario Kart.

05:01.899 --> 05:03.636
Can I talk to you for a second?

05:03.805 --> 05:05.458
It's not about shoes, is it?

05:06.624 --> 05:08.433
I don't think I could go
through that again.

05:08.823 --> 05:09.934
It's not about shoes.

05:10.103 --> 05:11.086
Then speak.

05:12.247 --> 05:13.980
Actually, can we do it in private?

05:14.149 --> 05:15.089
All right.

05:15.963 --> 05:16.963
Go away.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.506
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

05:23.152 --> 05:23.907
Thanks.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.424
Okay, so here's the thing:

05:26.870 --> 05:30.330
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics?

05:31.313 --> 05:33.041
A little physics?

05:33.977 --> 05:35.148
There's no such thing.

05:35.273 --> 05:37.456
Physics encompasses
the entire universe,

05:37.581 --> 05:40.025
from quantum particles
to supernovas,

05:40.150 --> 05:43.088
from spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.552
Yeah, okay, cool.
I don't need the PBS special.

05:46.649 --> 05:49.251
I just want to know enough
so I can talk to Leonard about his job.

05:49.376 --> 05:50.859
You know, like Bernadette does.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.645
- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- 'Cause I want to surprise him.

05:53.942 --> 05:55.650
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

05:55.775 --> 05:57.774
I'm sure
he'd be delightfully taken aback

05:57.899 --> 05:59.588
if you cleaned your apartment.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.148
Come on, this is important to me.

06:03.948 --> 06:07.905
This would be a massive undertaking,
and my time is limited and valuable.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.537
You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

06:12.003 --> 06:13.081
Okay, point.

06:14.876 --> 06:16.590
What sort of foundation do you have?

06:16.715 --> 06:18.878
Did you take any science
classes in school?

06:19.046 --> 06:21.047
Sure.
I did the one with the frogs.

06:24.276 --> 06:26.063
The one with the frogs.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.560
Actually, it was pretty cool.

06:28.685 --> 06:31.391
A lot of the girls threw up,
but I gutted that thing like a deer.

06:32.638 --> 06:34.410
I'm sorry, Penny. I don't think so.

06:34.578 --> 06:37.506
Come on! A smart guy like you,
it'll be a challenge.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.881
You can make it like an experiment.

06:41.438 --> 06:42.538
Interesting.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.492
I suppose if someone
could teach sign language

06:45.617 --> 06:47.217
to KoKo the gorilla...

06:48.741 --> 06:50.910
I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

06:51.111 --> 06:51.920
Great!

06:52.045 --> 06:54.231
It's a little insulting, but great.

06:54.356 --> 06:56.226
- I'll be KoKo.
- Not likely.

06:56.351 --> 06:58.383
KoKo learned to understand
over 2,000 words,

06:58.508 --> 07:00.962
not one of which had
anything to do with shoes.

07:03.902 --> 07:06.380
Hey, fellas.
This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

07:07.271 --> 07:09.021
My girlfriend Bernadette.

07:10.015 --> 07:12.098
- Who are all those people?
- Have no idea.

07:15.728 --> 07:18.229
Look, it's Howard
and his girlfriend Bernadette.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.733
Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.370
He doesn't mean salt mines.

07:24.495 --> 07:26.331
He means where he works.

07:28.486 --> 07:29.936
Yeah, no, I got it.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.244
So, how's your experiment going?

07:33.418 --> 07:35.924
Terrific, we're getting
the electron accelerator set up.

07:36.049 --> 07:37.916
We should be ready to go
day after tomorrow.

07:38.222 --> 07:41.002
- Boy, I'd love to see that.
- You're welcome to come.

07:41.466 --> 07:43.171
Really?
Oh, that'd be great.

07:43.525 --> 07:44.964
How exciting is that?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.732
Like Hanukkah in July.

07:48.643 --> 07:49.886
Do they have that?

07:54.820 --> 07:56.170
You got me again.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.988
This isn't non-fat yogurt.

08:01.195 --> 08:02.440
This is fatty fat fat.

08:03.363 --> 08:04.371
Excuse me.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.571
Could you grab me a napkin, sweetie?

08:06.696 --> 08:08.196
- Sure.
- Thanks, honey.

08:09.670 --> 08:11.574
All right, what is your deal?

08:12.123 --> 08:12.951
Excuse me?

08:13.119 --> 08:16.704
Inviting my girlfriend to come see
your electron accelerator?

08:17.099 --> 08:18.373
Yeah? So?

08:20.280 --> 08:22.899
You really are a piece of work.

08:23.687 --> 08:25.384
It's not enough
you get the prom queen,

08:25.509 --> 08:28.299
you have to get the head
of the decorating committee, too?

08:28.954 --> 08:32.122
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play innocent with me.

08:32.247 --> 08:33.508
I practically invented

08:33.633 --> 08:36.160
using fancy lab equipment
to seduce women.

08:37.812 --> 08:38.893
Has it ever worked?

08:39.312 --> 08:41.712
Not so far,
but that's not the point!

08:42.606 --> 08:45.191
Relax, I'm not interested
in your girlfriend.

08:45.675 --> 08:46.675
I hope not.

08:46.923 --> 08:48.962
Because you don't
want to mess with me.

08:54.901 --> 08:55.901
I'm crazy.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.156
I believe you.

09:02.702 --> 09:04.602
<i>Research journal, entry one.</i>

09:04.995 --> 09:07.179
<i>I'm about to embark
on one of the great challenges</i>

09:07.304 --> 09:08.994
<i>of my scientific career:</i>

09:10.741 --> 09:12.388
<i>teaching Penny physics.</i>

09:14.405 --> 09:16.859
<i>I'm calling it Project Gorilla.</i>

09:19.486 --> 09:20.435
Hey, Sheldon.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.061
Come in. Take a seat.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.772
<i>Subject has arrived.</i>

09:25.852 --> 09:28.452
<i>I've extended
a friendly casual greeting.</i>

09:29.159 --> 09:30.445
Ready to get started?

09:30.718 --> 09:31.718
One moment.

09:36.148 --> 09:38.948
<i>Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.</i>

09:40.550 --> 09:42.628
<i>Apparently, ignorance is bliss.</i>

09:45.272 --> 09:47.206
All right, let us begin.

09:48.831 --> 09:50.048
Where's your notebook?

09:51.135 --> 09:52.133
I don't have one.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.594
How are you going to take notes
without a notebook?

09:54.762 --> 09:55.988
I have to take notes?

09:56.113 --> 09:58.806
How else are you
gonna study for the tests?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.183
There's gonna be a test?

10:01.232 --> 10:02.232
Test-sss.

10:04.897 --> 10:05.926
Here.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.941
It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

10:12.226 --> 10:13.071
Thank you.

10:13.239 --> 10:15.948
You're welcome.
Now, Introduction to Physics.

10:16.899 --> 10:18.529
What is physics?

10:19.067 --> 10:22.789
Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika. "

10:25.084 --> 10:27.210
It's at this point
you'll want to start taking notes.

10:29.077 --> 10:32.682
"Physika" means the science
of natural things.

10:32.807 --> 10:36.677
And it is there, in ancient Greece,
that our story begins.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.304
Ancient Greece?!

10:38.472 --> 10:40.348
Hush. If you have questions,
raise your hand.

10:41.850 --> 10:45.144
It's a warm summer evening,
circa 600 BC.

10:45.312 --> 10:49.190
You've finished your shopping
at the local market, or agora...

10:53.274 --> 10:55.209
and you look up at the night sky.

10:55.334 --> 10:58.764
There you notice
some of the stars seem to move,

10:58.889 --> 11:01.572
so you name them "planetes,"

11:01.697 --> 11:03.118
or "wanderer. "

11:11.307 --> 11:13.840
Does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

11:14.386 --> 11:17.172
This is the beginning
of a 2,600-year journey

11:17.297 --> 11:19.220
we're going to take together from...

11:20.681 --> 11:21.854
the ancient Greeks

11:21.979 --> 11:24.100
through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

11:24.535 --> 11:25.810
to Erwin Schrodinger

11:25.978 --> 11:29.480
to the Dutch researchers
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

11:31.477 --> 11:33.067
2,600 years?

11:33.235 --> 11:34.125
Give or take.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.642
As I was saying,
it's a warm summer evening

11:36.767 --> 11:38.267
in ancient Greece...

11:40.242 --> 11:41.868
I have to go to the bathroom.

11:42.257 --> 11:44.882
- Can't you hold it?
- Not for 2,600 years.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.398
<i>Project Gorilla, entry two.</i>

11:58.358 --> 11:59.844
<i>I am exhausted.</i>

12:18.490 --> 12:20.190
It unhooks in the front.

12:21.612 --> 12:23.074
That explains a lot.

12:27.850 --> 12:29.948
<i>Howard, I'm home!</i>

12:31.283 --> 12:32.283
Of course.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.651
<i>Senior fitness was cancelled.</i>

12:35.936 --> 12:38.966
<i>It turns out you can forget
how to ride a bike.</i>

12:40.199 --> 12:44.114
<i>I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.</i>

12:45.635 --> 12:46.947
That's great, Ma!

12:47.350 --> 12:49.816
<i>What's great about
an 80-year-old Armenian man</i>

12:49.941 --> 12:52.041
<i>with half his chin scraped off?!</i>

12:53.434 --> 12:55.432
- I guess I should go.
- No, don't move.

12:55.557 --> 12:58.614
Hey, Ma, can I have
lamb stew for dinner?

12:58.739 --> 13:02.492
<i>Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.</i>

13:02.824 --> 13:05.130
Please? I got a real hankering.

13:07.974 --> 13:11.921
<i>Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy face.</i>

13:13.340 --> 13:15.150
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

13:18.835 --> 13:21.961
<i>Do you want the regular peas
or the Le Sueur?</i>

13:22.451 --> 13:25.261
Always Le Sueur peas with lamb stew!

13:25.386 --> 13:28.098
<i>You're right!
When you're right, you're right!</i>

13:30.874 --> 13:32.623
<i>What if they're out of the Le Sueur?</i>

13:32.748 --> 13:34.298
Then get the regular!

13:35.409 --> 13:37.804
<i>All right! You don't have to yell!</i>

13:39.736 --> 13:41.086
Sorry about that.

13:44.583 --> 13:45.866
Let me put that on vibrate.

13:46.413 --> 13:48.063
I'm already on vibrate.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.163
You know, that one I got.

13:52.868 --> 13:55.149
Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

13:55.274 --> 13:56.585
What do you mean?

13:56.753 --> 13:58.717
He says if I go see
his experiment tomorrow

13:58.842 --> 14:00.419
it might weird you out.

14:01.103 --> 14:02.254
Really? He said that?

14:02.724 --> 14:04.259
You're jealous of Leonard?

14:04.858 --> 14:06.153
Me? No.

14:06.757 --> 14:09.875
I may have mentioned
that it's a little inappropriate

14:10.000 --> 14:12.434
to be asking another man's girlfriend
to his experiment

14:12.559 --> 14:15.055
without first discussing it
with said man.

14:15.180 --> 14:17.731
Do I need to ask your permission
to hang out with Leonard?

14:18.301 --> 14:20.302
I didn't say anything like that.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.497
I said Leonard has
to ask my permission.

14:25.849 --> 14:29.099
Come on, I don't want to eat
lamb stew with my mother.

14:30.655 --> 14:32.855
Damn, I was this close on the bra.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.503
Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong

14:39.671 --> 14:42.135
and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

14:42.260 --> 14:45.509
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared

14:46.003 --> 14:46.785
as "A"

14:46.910 --> 14:48.819
and we get force-- earth gravity--

14:48.944 --> 14:52.744
equals mass times 9.8 meters
per second per second.

14:52.869 --> 14:55.180
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"

14:55.305 --> 14:57.020
and what do we know from this?

15:02.293 --> 15:03.694
We know that...

15:04.821 --> 15:07.121
Newton was a really smart cookie.

15:08.095 --> 15:10.826
Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

15:11.776 --> 15:14.830
No, Fig Newtons are named
after a small town in Massachusetts.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.165
Don't write that down!

15:18.668 --> 15:22.087
Now, if "ma" equals "mg,"
what does that imply?

15:22.573 --> 15:24.757
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.243
I just told you.

15:26.368 --> 15:28.885
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

15:30.311 --> 15:31.847
You don't have to be so mean!

15:32.015 --> 15:32.930
I'm sorry.

15:33.055 --> 15:35.805
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.897
- No, you just suck at teaching.
- Really?

15:41.261 --> 15:43.609
Of those two explanations,
which one seems the most likely?

15:43.777 --> 15:44.791
Oh, God...

15:45.933 --> 15:47.487
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,

15:47.656 --> 15:49.009
but you're going too fast.

15:49.134 --> 15:51.033
Can you just back up a little bit?

15:51.651 --> 15:52.651
All right.

15:53.897 --> 15:56.797
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

15:57.080 --> 15:58.498
Not that far back!

16:00.199 --> 16:02.252
At what point
did you begin to feel lost?

16:02.420 --> 16:05.380
I don't know.
Where were we looking up at the sky?

16:05.549 --> 16:07.345
- Greece.
- Damn it!

16:08.189 --> 16:11.637
There's no need to get frustrated.
People learn at different rates.

16:12.098 --> 16:16.475
Unlike objects
falling in a vacuum, which...?

16:18.984 --> 16:21.480
"ma" equals "mg"...?

16:22.211 --> 16:23.706
- Squared?
- No.

16:24.911 --> 16:26.446
- Aristotle?
- No.

16:27.677 --> 16:28.677
Five?

16:30.277 --> 16:32.344
Then I don't know.

16:34.207 --> 16:37.134
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm stupid!

16:37.895 --> 16:39.595
That's no reason to cry.

16:41.259 --> 16:43.317
One cries because one is sad.

16:43.442 --> 16:45.690
For example, I cry
because others are stupid

16:45.815 --> 16:47.315
and it makes me sad.

16:49.685 --> 16:52.594
Okay, look, can we just please
forget about all this extra stuff

16:52.719 --> 16:55.222
and can you just tell me
what Leonard does?

16:55.390 --> 16:56.487
All right.

16:56.861 --> 16:59.100
Leonard is attempting to learn

16:59.225 --> 17:01.937
why sub-atomic particles
move the way they do.

17:03.037 --> 17:04.534
Really? That's it?

17:04.659 --> 17:06.525
That doesn't sound so complicated.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.595
It's not.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.570
That's why Leonard does it.

17:12.958 --> 17:14.767
Okay, I just have one question.

17:14.892 --> 17:17.327
What exactly are
sub-atomic particles?

17:17.796 --> 17:19.246
A good question.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.372
Thank you.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.657
And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves: "What is physics?"

17:23.835 --> 17:24.751
Oh, balls.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.296
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

17:30.368 --> 17:32.300
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

17:32.710 --> 17:33.760
What did I do now?

17:33.986 --> 17:37.236
I was in bed with Bernadette,
and you text-blocked me.

17:38.604 --> 17:39.516
What?!

17:39.684 --> 17:42.723
We were completely naked,
about to devour each other when...

17:44.212 --> 17:46.857
you text her that I have a problem
with her hanging out with you.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.130
You do have a problem
with her hanging out with me.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.112
Yeah, but that's not
what you tell her.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.697
What was I supposed to tell her?

17:53.865 --> 17:55.993
I don't know; something
that doesn't make me come off

17:56.118 --> 17:58.060
as a petty, jealous douche.

17:59.376 --> 18:01.220
And what would that be?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.191
Come on, do I have
to think of everything?

18:07.200 --> 18:09.379
Hey, Leonard.
Am I too late to see the experiment?

18:12.550 --> 18:15.095
- What are you doing here?
- Same thing you're doing here.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.345
I came to see Leonard's experiment.

18:17.605 --> 18:20.390
No, you didn't. You said
Leonard's experiment was stupid.

18:24.657 --> 18:26.855
You told her
my experiment was stupid?

18:27.465 --> 18:29.191
I was just repeating
what Sheldon said.

18:30.586 --> 18:31.957
Let's not get off topic.

18:32.082 --> 18:34.829
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

18:34.954 --> 18:38.200
I was wrong to tell you
who you should be friends with.

18:38.635 --> 18:40.535
Should I leave you two alone?

18:40.704 --> 18:42.037
No, you should hear this.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.623
Okay, good,
'cause I wasn't really gonna go.

18:45.873 --> 18:48.204
Look, I know I come off

18:48.329 --> 18:51.052
as confident and worldly, but...

18:52.923 --> 18:54.549
the truth is I'm not.

18:54.794 --> 18:55.994
We're shocked.

18:58.290 --> 19:01.765
Which is why I tend to feel
threatened by other guys.

19:02.178 --> 19:04.716
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

19:07.775 --> 19:10.273
But I now realize
how foolish that is.

19:10.521 --> 19:13.902
He had a panic attack once
when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.303
It was a full turtleneck.

19:18.050 --> 19:19.324
Why aren't you helping me?

19:19.663 --> 19:20.628
I don't know.

19:20.753 --> 19:23.394
Maybe because I'm... crazy?!

19:27.994 --> 19:31.211
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

19:31.736 --> 19:34.738
What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?

19:35.133 --> 19:37.926
It's up to you. He didn't call
your experiment stupid.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.304
Come here, tushy face.

19:43.533 --> 19:46.429
"Tushy face. "
That is going on Twitter right now.

19:53.677 --> 19:56.153
Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.364
The interference pattern was so cool
when the electron beam was on.

19:59.859 --> 20:02.784
Glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

20:10.137 --> 20:12.169
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

20:12.383 --> 20:15.464
Recently I've been thinking that
given the parameters of your experiment,

20:15.632 --> 20:18.784
the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated metal rings

20:18.909 --> 20:20.942
is qualitatively no different
than the experiment

20:21.067 --> 20:23.002
already conducted
in the Netherlands.

20:26.548 --> 20:29.541
Their observed phase shift in the
diffusing electrons inside the ring

20:29.666 --> 20:31.788
already conclusively demonstrated
the electric analogue

20:31.913 --> 20:34.858
of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum-interference effect.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.258
That's it. That's all I know.

20:43.894 --> 20:44.951
Oh, wait...!

20:46.016 --> 20:48.108
Fig Newtons were named
after a town in Massachusetts,

20:48.233 --> 20:49.706
not the scientist.
