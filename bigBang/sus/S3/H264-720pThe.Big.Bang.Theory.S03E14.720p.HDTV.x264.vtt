WEBVTT

00:15.006 --> 00:16.894
Whatcha doing?

00:16.962 --> 00:19.726
I'm attempting to view my work
as a fleeting peripheral image

00:19.794 --> 00:22.559
so as to engage the superior
colliculus of my brain.

00:25.795 --> 00:27.160
Interesting.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.030
I usually just have coffee.

00:29.867 --> 00:31.137
You've been up all night?

00:31.204 --> 00:32.141
Is it morning?

00:32.209 --> 00:33.146
Yes.

00:33.214 --> 00:34.714
Then I've been up all night.

00:37.151 --> 00:38.658
And you're stuck?

00:38.725 --> 00:40.393
Why else would a person
try to engage

00:40.461 --> 00:42.534
their superior colliculus?

00:42.601 --> 00:46.576
Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help
you till I've had my coffee.

00:53.824 --> 00:56.961
Penny, I told you if you don't
put him in his crate at night

00:57.029 --> 00:58.998
he just runs around
the apartment.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.639
What is he doing now?

01:03.707 --> 01:05.977
LEONARD: Hmm, he's
either isolating the terms

01:06.045 --> 01:09.883
of his formula and examining
them individually,

01:09.950 --> 01:11.352
or...

01:11.420 --> 01:13.654
looking for the alligator
that swallowed his hand

01:13.722 --> 01:15.756
after Peter Pan cut it off.

01:15.824 --> 01:18.459
Captain Hook's hand was eaten
by a crocodile,

01:18.527 --> 01:20.161
not an alligator.

01:20.229 --> 01:24.700
If you're going to mock me, at
least get your facts straight.

01:24.767 --> 01:27.903
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:27.971 --> 01:30.005
I can't see it!

01:30.073 --> 01:31.507
It just won't coalesce.

01:31.574 --> 01:33.242
Maybe you need
a fresh start.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.378
You're right.

01:43.155 --> 01:45.291
(tires squealing
and car horns honking)

01:46.627 --> 01:49.229
It's a great idea, Leonard.
Thank you.

01:50.966 --> 01:54.503

02:15.917 --> 02:17.730
Electrons move
through graphene...

02:18.020 --> 02:20.355
act as if they
have no mass...

02:22.425 --> 02:23.959
How long has
he been stuck?

02:24.027 --> 02:26.228
Intellectually about 30 hours.

02:26.296 --> 02:28.131
Emotionally about 29 years.

02:28.198 --> 02:31.735
Unit cell contains
two carbon atoms...

02:31.802 --> 02:35.038
Interior angle
of a hexagon is 120 degrees.

02:37.976 --> 02:40.411
Have you tried
rebooting him?

02:40.479 --> 02:42.680
(chuckles)

02:42.748 --> 02:43.781
(laughing)

02:43.849 --> 02:47.117
No, I think it's
a firmware problem.

02:47.185 --> 02:50.154
Hey, it's Disco Night
at the Moonlight Roller Rink

02:50.221 --> 02:51.455
in Glendale tonight.

02:51.523 --> 02:53.758
Who's up for getting down?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.393
That's perfect.

02:55.460 --> 02:58.028
Bernadette's been hocking me
to take her roller skating.

02:58.096 --> 02:59.463
I think Penny likes to skate.

02:59.530 --> 03:00.864
The four of us could double.

03:00.932 --> 03:02.399
What could be better?
We're in.

03:02.467 --> 03:05.869
Great. It's not like I brought
it up because I wanted to go.

03:08.673 --> 03:10.507
You can come with us.

03:10.575 --> 03:12.109
No, it's okay.
I don't have to go.

03:12.177 --> 03:13.811
I'm happy just to guide
you and your ladies

03:13.878 --> 03:15.512
to suitable
entertainment choices.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.182
I'm a walking brown Yelp.com.

03:19.785 --> 03:23.120
Structure, constant
structure. One atom...

03:23.188 --> 03:25.489
Boy, he's really gone,
isn't he?

03:25.557 --> 03:28.893
Yeah, this morning he used
a stick of butter as deodorant.

03:28.961 --> 03:32.296
I thought I smelled popcorn.

03:35.401 --> 03:36.701
Pattern is the same
as fermions...

03:36.769 --> 03:37.802
Travels on
the pathways...

03:37.870 --> 03:39.170
Hexagonal...
It's always hexagonal...

03:39.238 --> 03:42.173
I haven't seen him this stuck
since he tried to figure out

03:42.241 --> 03:43.508
<i>the third Matrix movie.</i>

03:43.576 --> 03:45.210
(gasps)

03:46.111 --> 03:48.479
Hey, those are my lima beans!

03:48.547 --> 03:51.984
Not lima beans, carbon atoms.

03:52.052 --> 03:53.719
But if I don't eat
my lima beans,

03:53.787 --> 03:55.387
I can't have my cookie.

03:55.455 --> 03:56.922
Here, you want my peas?

03:56.990 --> 03:58.123
The peas- perfect.

03:58.191 --> 03:59.592
They can be electrons.

03:59.659 --> 04:00.860
Want my corn?

04:00.927 --> 04:03.095
Don't be ridiculous.

04:04.163 --> 04:05.864
What would I do with corn?

04:05.932 --> 04:09.768
So roller skating
- should we all grab a bite to eat first?

04:09.836 --> 04:11.269
Good. P.F. Chang's?

04:11.337 --> 04:12.637
My mom has coupons.

04:12.705 --> 04:13.839
Great.

04:13.907 --> 04:15.907
Your mom's not
coming, right?

04:15.975 --> 04:19.510
Not this time, I promise.

04:19.578 --> 04:21.613
Okay, just to be clear,
roller skating was my idea,

04:21.680 --> 04:24.382
and I'm very unhappy that you
turned it into a double date,

04:24.450 --> 04:26.551
and I hope you both fall
on your asses

04:26.619 --> 04:27.919
and break your coccyxes.

04:30.255 --> 04:33.591
The plural of coccyx
is coccyges.

04:33.658 --> 04:36.360
Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.

04:38.930 --> 04:39.996
Oh, my God.

04:40.064 --> 04:41.631
Have you ever
been so embarrassed?

04:41.699 --> 04:42.866
Not recently.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.501
I don't know
which was lamer:

04:44.569 --> 04:46.770
their roller-skating
or their disco dancing.

04:46.838 --> 04:48.605
For me, the worst part

04:48.673 --> 04:51.975
was when people
saw us leave with them.

04:52.043 --> 04:56.080
You had some nice moves
out there, Howard.

04:56.147 --> 04:57.248
Thanks. You, too.
Yeah.

04:57.315 --> 04:59.450
Did you notice all the
people looking at us?

05:00.719 --> 05:03.621
Not really. I was
in my boogie zone.

05:05.891 --> 05:07.959
When Howard tried
to do the splits...

05:08.026 --> 05:09.093
Shh.

05:09.161 --> 05:10.561
Sorry. I'm moving
a little slow.

05:10.629 --> 05:12.429
I think I bruised
my coccyx.

05:12.497 --> 05:13.830
Oh, poor baby.

05:13.898 --> 05:15.766
Don't tell Koothrappali.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.267
After you.

05:17.334 --> 05:18.634
Oh, what a gentleman.

05:18.702 --> 05:20.102
Hey, Sheldon.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.137
(screams) LEONARD: Oh, my God!

05:22.205 --> 05:23.372
Are you...

05:24.374 --> 05:25.741
SHELDON:
Good Lord!

05:25.809 --> 05:26.808
You're ruining everything!

05:26.876 --> 05:28.009
Oh, damn.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.143
Are you okay?

05:29.211 --> 05:30.478
Do I look okay?

05:30.546 --> 05:32.513
Don't bark at me.
I fell, too.

05:32.581 --> 05:34.381
Oh, you've been falling
all night. You're used to it.

05:36.385 --> 05:38.185
Sheldon, what the
hell are you doing?

05:38.253 --> 05:40.054
The same thing I've been doing
for three days.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.556
Trying to figure out
why electrons

05:41.623 --> 05:43.324
behave as if they have no mass

05:43.392 --> 05:45.092
when traveling
through a graphene sheet.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.294
With marbles?

05:46.361 --> 05:47.629
Well, I needed something bigger

05:47.696 --> 05:49.764
than peas, now, didn't I?

05:49.832 --> 05:53.368
Sheldon, when was the last time
you got any sleep?

05:53.436 --> 05:54.603
I don't know- two, three days.

05:54.670 --> 05:55.837
Not important.

05:55.905 --> 05:58.207
I don't need sleep.
I need answers.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.842
I need to determine where

05:59.909 --> 06:02.745
in this swamp
of unbalanced formulas

06:02.812 --> 06:06.348
squatteth the toad of truth.

06:06.416 --> 06:07.850
Toad of truth?

06:07.917 --> 06:09.685
Is that a physics thing?

06:09.753 --> 06:12.388
No, that's a
crazy thing.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.223
Okay, Sheldon.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.759
What happens
to our neuroreceptors

06:16.826 --> 06:19.361
when we don't get
enough REM sleep?

06:20.897 --> 06:24.366
They lose their sensitivity
to serotonin and norepinephrine.

06:24.434 --> 06:25.568
Which leads to...?

06:25.635 --> 06:28.537
Impaired cognitive function.

06:28.604 --> 06:32.840
Right, so march in there,
brush your teeth and go to bed.

06:32.908 --> 06:36.444
But I don't want to go to bed.

06:37.613 --> 06:39.814
I'm going to count
to three. One...

06:39.881 --> 06:41.582
Oh, all right.

06:45.119 --> 06:47.988
That was amazing
how you handled him.

06:48.055 --> 06:50.156
I know how to deal
with stubborn children.

06:50.224 --> 06:53.726
My mother used to run an illegal
day care center in our basement.

06:59.766 --> 07:02.168
(evil laughter)

07:06.606 --> 07:10.042
Leonard, you're... you're
giggling in your sleep.

07:10.109 --> 07:11.343
It's not me.

07:11.410 --> 07:13.045
It's my new ringtone.

07:13.113 --> 07:15.681
<i>The Joker from Batman.</i>

07:15.749 --> 07:18.050
Well, it creeps me out.

07:18.118 --> 07:21.488
Me, too, but I paid
three bucks for it.

07:21.555 --> 07:23.023
Just answer the phone.

07:23.090 --> 07:25.059
(sighs)

07:27.796 --> 07:29.564
Hello.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.934
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.003
Yeah, yeah, he's my roommate.

07:37.339 --> 07:39.573
Oh, God, is he okay?

07:41.343 --> 07:43.044
Yeah, all-all right.
I'll be right there.

07:43.112 --> 07:44.712
What happened?

07:44.780 --> 07:48.249
Sheldon's escaped
and is terrorizing the village.

07:50.119 --> 07:51.952
Okay. Have fun.

07:55.457 --> 07:57.224
Hi. I'm Dr. Hofstadter.

07:57.292 --> 07:59.258
Where is he?
Ball pit.

08:02.162 --> 08:04.363
Thanks for not
calling the cops.

08:04.431 --> 08:05.964
Oh, hey, it's
no big deal.

08:06.032 --> 08:08.200
My sister's got a kid
who's special.

08:09.269 --> 08:12.771
Yeah, well,
he's extra special.

08:14.474 --> 08:15.607
Hey, Shelly.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.144
What you doing?

08:18.211 --> 08:19.645
Size ratio was all wrong.

08:19.713 --> 08:20.980
Couldn't visualize it.

08:21.048 --> 08:23.115
Needed bigger carbon atoms.

08:24.151 --> 08:26.152
Sure, sure.

08:27.355 --> 08:29.422
How did you get
into this place?

08:29.490 --> 08:32.025
Back door has a five-pin
tumbler system,

08:32.093 --> 08:33.960
single-circuit alarm.
Child's play.

08:35.429 --> 08:38.265
You can start sorting protons
and neutrons

08:38.333 --> 08:40.334
while I build carbon atoms.

08:40.402 --> 08:41.702
No, I don't think so.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.304
We need to go home now.

08:43.372 --> 08:45.540
But I'm still working.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.242
If you don't come out of there,

08:47.310 --> 08:49.177
I'm going to have
to drag you out.

08:50.347 --> 08:53.014
You can try,
but you'll never catch me.

08:56.586 --> 08:59.187
For God's sakes.

09:04.226 --> 09:05.859
Sheldon, come here!

09:05.927 --> 09:08.228
Bazinga.

09:10.531 --> 09:15.036
Bazinga.

09:16.071 --> 09:20.042
Bazinga.

09:27.052 --> 09:28.352
<i>OF GAIN DET(whispering):

09:28.420 --> 09:29.653
Leonard and Penny.
(screams)

09:29.721 --> 09:31.555
What?
What, what, what?

09:36.261 --> 09:38.195
Leonard and Penny.

09:38.263 --> 09:40.197
What?

09:40.265 --> 09:41.999
I have good news.
LEONARD: And you had

09:42.067 --> 09:43.568
to barge in here
and wake us up

09:43.636 --> 09:44.703
in the middle
of the night?

09:44.770 --> 09:46.371
Your cell phone was off.

09:46.439 --> 09:48.841
Because we didn't want
to be disturbed.

09:48.908 --> 09:51.844
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

09:51.912 --> 09:54.881
Sheldon, what
do you want?

09:54.949 --> 09:57.651
I came to tell you
I've got the answer.

09:57.718 --> 09:59.419
Really?

09:59.487 --> 10:01.854
You figured out
the graphene problem?

10:01.922 --> 10:03.990
No, no, I'm still
hopelessly stuck on that,

10:04.057 --> 10:07.192
but I figured out
how to figure it out.

10:07.260 --> 10:08.861
Okay, you know what,
Leonard, I know I said

10:08.928 --> 10:10.429
I could handle your roommate,
but I was wrong.

10:10.497 --> 10:11.763
We're going to
have to break up.

10:12.799 --> 10:14.900
What are you
talking about?

10:14.967 --> 10:16.868
(clears throat)
Oh. (sighs)

10:18.904 --> 10:20.071
Einstein.

10:20.139 --> 10:23.107
Yeah, I'm going to need
a little more.

10:23.175 --> 10:25.544
Albert Einstein.

10:27.914 --> 10:30.182
Keep going.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.552
When Albert Einstein came up
with special relativity,

10:32.619 --> 10:34.754
he was working at
the patent office.

10:34.822 --> 10:37.357
So, you're going to go work
at the patent office?

10:37.425 --> 10:38.925
Don't be absurd.

10:38.993 --> 10:40.393
That's in Washington.

10:40.461 --> 10:42.762
You know I could never live
in a city whose streets

10:42.830 --> 10:44.730
are laid out in a
wheel-and-spoke pattern.

10:44.798 --> 10:46.632
No. I'm going to find

10:46.700 --> 10:48.300
a similarly menial job

10:48.368 --> 10:51.402
where my basal ganglia are
occupied with a routine task,

10:51.470 --> 10:53.003
freeing my prefrontal cortex

10:53.071 --> 10:55.406
to work quietly in the
background on my problem.

10:56.775 --> 10:57.908
Sounds like a great plan.

10:57.976 --> 10:59.042
Of course it is.

10:59.110 --> 11:00.377
Even talking to you is

11:00.445 --> 11:01.979
sufficiently menial
that I can feel

11:02.047 --> 11:03.614
the proverbial juices
starting to flow.

11:03.682 --> 11:06.384
Okay, well, thanks
for sharing with us.

11:06.452 --> 11:08.220
Good night.
You're welcome.

11:08.287 --> 11:09.922
And good night to you, too.

11:09.990 --> 11:11.390
(sighs)

11:11.458 --> 11:14.227
Oh, by the way, I was
watching you sleep for a moment,

11:14.294 --> 11:15.628
and I noticed that your snoring

11:15.696 --> 11:17.764
seems to be worse
when you're on your back.

11:17.832 --> 11:19.733
Leonard doesn't snore.

11:19.801 --> 11:22.435
No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.

11:24.405 --> 11:26.873
Told you.

11:28.242 --> 11:31.911
So, Mr. Cooper, you're
looking for a job.

11:31.979 --> 11:34.213
A menial job.

11:34.281 --> 11:36.115
Like yours.

11:38.184 --> 11:40.452
Why, thank you for noticing.

11:41.654 --> 11:44.456
I'm "Menial Employee
of the Month."

11:45.658 --> 11:47.993
Do you have
a particular field in mind?

11:48.061 --> 11:49.294
I do.

11:49.362 --> 11:51.096
For thousands of years,

11:51.164 --> 11:52.965
the lowest classes
of the human race

11:53.032 --> 11:55.534
have spent their lives laboring
to erect monuments

11:55.602 --> 11:57.436
under the lash of their betters,

11:57.504 --> 11:58.637
until finally,

11:58.705 --> 12:00.038
they dropped down

12:00.106 --> 12:03.676
and became one with the dust
through which they trudged.

12:03.744 --> 12:06.145
Do you have anything like that?

12:07.648 --> 12:09.449
No.

12:09.517 --> 12:11.585
Shouldn't you check
your database?

12:13.888 --> 12:15.522
No.

12:18.293 --> 12:20.961
You didn't really type?

12:21.029 --> 12:24.297
I didn't really have to.

12:24.365 --> 12:26.332
So, how about
construction?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.268
Oh, that would be good!

12:28.335 --> 12:31.671
Sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail

12:31.738 --> 12:33.939
as my working-class
fellows and I

12:34.007 --> 12:36.041
sit perched precariously
on a girder

12:36.109 --> 12:38.143
high above the metropolis.

12:38.211 --> 12:41.580
No, no. This is
putting up sheetrock

12:41.648 --> 12:44.650
at a housing project
in Rosemead.

12:44.718 --> 12:46.152
I could do that.

12:46.220 --> 12:47.587
Good.
One question.

12:47.655 --> 12:50.156
Yes?
What's sheetrock?

12:50.224 --> 12:52.059
Moving on.

12:53.228 --> 12:54.328
How about

12:54.396 --> 12:56.164
doing deliveries for a florist?

12:56.232 --> 12:57.832
That seems acceptable.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.735
Do you have your own car?
I don't drive.

13:00.803 --> 13:02.937
Of course you don't.

13:04.173 --> 13:07.142
Mr. Cooper, let me
just ask you a question.

13:07.210 --> 13:08.843
What was your last job?

13:08.911 --> 13:11.379
Senior theoretical
particle physicist at CalTech,

13:11.447 --> 13:15.082
focusing on M theory, or, in
layman's terms, string theory.

13:15.150 --> 13:17.152
I see.

13:17.219 --> 13:19.153
Just give me a second.

13:23.025 --> 13:25.359
Security!

13:30.765 --> 13:34.100
Okay, I'll get those drinks
started for you.

13:34.168 --> 13:36.169
Behind you.

13:37.204 --> 13:39.405
Sheldon, what the hell
are you doing?

13:39.473 --> 13:41.541
I'm trying to get
these tables cleared.

13:41.609 --> 13:42.408
We're slammed.

13:43.444 --> 13:44.978
No, wait, wait,
no, wait.

13:45.045 --> 13:46.813
<i>Wh-What are you
doing here?</i>

13:46.881 --> 13:48.648
A reasonable question.

13:48.716 --> 13:51.117
I asked myself, what is
the most mind-numbing,

13:51.185 --> 13:53.019
pedestrian job conceivable,

13:53.087 --> 13:55.055
and three answers came to mind:

13:55.123 --> 13:57.824
uh, toll booth attendant,
Apple Store genius...

13:59.628 --> 14:01.562
...and what Penny does.

14:01.630 --> 14:02.730
Now...

14:02.798 --> 14:04.766
since I don't like

14:04.834 --> 14:06.234
touching other people's coins,

14:06.302 --> 14:07.936
and I refuse to contribute

14:08.003 --> 14:10.605
to the devaluation
of the word "genius,"

14:10.673 --> 14:12.508
here I am.

14:12.575 --> 14:15.744
You just, you just walked in
and they hired you,

14:15.812 --> 14:16.779
just like that?

14:16.846 --> 14:18.380
Oh, heavens, no.

14:18.448 --> 14:20.882
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

14:20.950 --> 14:22.651
I simply came in,
picked up a tray,

14:22.719 --> 14:25.486
and started
"working for the man."

14:25.554 --> 14:25.620
Let me get that plate
out of your way.

14:27.689 --> 14:28.622
Sheldon,

14:28.690 --> 14:29.857
this is ridiculous.

14:29.924 --> 14:30.924
Is it?

14:30.992 --> 14:32.559
Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany

14:32.627 --> 14:34.794
regarding the polymer
degradation phenomenon

14:34.862 --> 14:37.430
while scraping
congealed nachos off a plate.

14:37.498 --> 14:39.966
Bernadette, table 10
wants their check.

14:40.034 --> 14:40.967
Thanks, Sheldon.

14:41.035 --> 14:41.968
Sheldon,

14:42.036 --> 14:43.169
wait, this isn't even what I do.

14:43.237 --> 14:45.105
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

14:45.173 --> 14:47.708
You're right.
That is more menial.

14:47.776 --> 14:51.512
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.

14:52.614 --> 14:54.182
I don't recommend the salmon.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.552
I saw it in the kitchen.

14:59.089 --> 15:02.758
All right,
one bacon cheeseburger,

15:02.826 --> 15:06.661
breaking two Jewish dietary
restrictions simultaneously-

15:06.729 --> 15:08.697
kudos.

15:08.764 --> 15:10.798
Beer-battered
fish and chips.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.800
Now, here's your
tartar sauce.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.368
I also brought you salsa.

15:14.436 --> 15:16.136
It's a little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it.

15:16.204 --> 15:17.838
It's zingy.

15:18.906 --> 15:21.741
And for you, Factory
Burrito Grande-

15:21.809 --> 15:23.576
no cheese,
no sour cream,

15:23.644 --> 15:26.680
no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.

15:27.615 --> 15:29.616
Bon appÃ©tit.

15:29.684 --> 15:31.719
Hang on.

15:31.787 --> 15:32.754
Black beans, not pinto beans?

15:32.821 --> 15:33.755
Yes.

15:33.822 --> 15:35.056
Double guacamole?
Of course.

15:35.124 --> 15:36.224
No cilantro?
Nope.

15:36.292 --> 15:37.826
Lettuce shredded,
not chopped? Yep.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.060
You understand
why I'm doing this to you?

15:39.128 --> 15:40.929
I do.
That'll be all.

15:42.931 --> 15:45.066
That was fun.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.167
(laughter)

15:47.235 --> 15:49.170
How long can he keep this up?

15:49.237 --> 15:50.938
I heard about this
professor at MIT

15:51.006 --> 15:52.339
who melted down,
bought a van,

15:52.407 --> 15:55.008
and spent the rest of his life
as a mobile dog groomer.

15:55.076 --> 15:56.843
He never went back
to the university?

15:56.911 --> 16:00.046
Only to shampoo Professor
Shamburg's shih tzu.

16:01.081 --> 16:04.250
Sheesh.

16:04.318 --> 16:04.384
I bet if we all chipped in,
we could buy Sheldon a van.

16:08.589 --> 16:10.190
But he's afraid of dogs.

16:10.258 --> 16:12.893
Yeah, that's the only thing
wrong with that plan.

16:14.329 --> 16:17.898
Hey, guys, sorry you had
to wait, but we are swamped.

16:17.966 --> 16:19.267
What's this?

16:19.335 --> 16:21.035
Sheldon took our order.

16:21.103 --> 16:23.537
Sheldon doesn't work here.

16:23.605 --> 16:25.806
Well, honey, not to complain,

16:25.874 --> 16:28.710
but we were starting
to think you didn't either.

16:28.777 --> 16:30.078
(crashing)

16:31.114 --> 16:33.749
Is that really necessary?

16:34.985 --> 16:38.120
Good Lord.

16:38.188 --> 16:40.422
The interference pattern
in the fracture.

16:40.489 --> 16:41.890
The motion
of the wave

16:41.957 --> 16:43.624
through the molecular structure.

16:43.692 --> 16:45.827
I've been looking
at it all wrong.

16:45.894 --> 16:48.295
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.

16:48.363 --> 16:50.664
They move through the graphene
as a wave.

16:51.733 --> 16:54.567
It's a wave!

16:56.603 --> 16:59.305
The moment to applaud
would be now.

17:00.306 --> 17:03.008
Troglodytes.

17:04.010 --> 17:05.110
Sheldon... where are you going?

17:05.178 --> 17:07.079
Aren't you going
to clean this up?

17:07.146 --> 17:09.148
I'm sorry. I don't work here.

17:11.751 --> 17:15.454
âª âª

17:21.694 --> 17:24.696
Happy now?
I'm on a cloud.

17:24.763 --> 17:26.965
Swing me.

17:27.032 --> 17:44.349
âª âª

17:49.261 --> 17:52.130
Sheldon, come here.

17:52.198 --> 17:54.198
Bazinga.

18:01.507 --> 18:04.108
Bazinga.

18:05.977 --> 18:07.711
Bazinga.

18:08.914 --> 18:10.715
Bazinga.

18:13.351 --> 18:15.352
Bazinga!
