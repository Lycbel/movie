WEBVTT

00:20.253 --> 00:22.861
Will you please turn
your shirt off?

00:22.895 --> 00:24.032
What?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.699
I'm giving myself
dramatic entrance music.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.804
People will know I'm awesome
and to be feared.

00:28.838 --> 00:30.407
Right.

00:30.442 --> 00:32.745
There's nothing more awesome
and frightening than a man

00:32.779 --> 00:35.816
who's got music blasting
from between his nipples.

00:37.451 --> 00:39.820
Hey, Stuart,
what's going on?

00:39.854 --> 00:42.021
Well, you might want to mark
your Google calendars.

00:42.056 --> 00:44.591
Stan Lee is coming to do
a signing on Thursday.

00:44.625 --> 00:47.426
Did he finally write a sequel
to his autobiography?

00:47.461 --> 00:51.263
I'm sure ages 79 through 87
were just action-packed.

00:51.297 --> 00:54.065
No, just a regular
comic signing.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.570
My uncle is his dermatologist
and Stan's doing him a favor.

00:57.604 --> 00:59.906
Oh, I don't want
to know that!

00:59.941 --> 01:02.312
How can I possibly discuss
with Stan Lee

01:02.346 --> 01:03.913
the scientific foundations

01:03.948 --> 01:05.749
for interstellar flight
on a silver surfboard

01:05.784 --> 01:07.820
when part of my brain
will be scanning his face

01:07.854 --> 01:11.391
for signs of contagious
skin disease?

01:11.425 --> 01:14.861
Stan Lee does not have
a contagious skin disease.

01:14.895 --> 01:18.867
Well, look who thinks
he's Stuart's uncle now.

01:18.901 --> 01:20.068
Can't believe it.

01:20.102 --> 01:22.537
We're going to meet Stan Lee!

01:31.480 --> 01:34.214
I'm sad to say
I taught him those moves.

01:36.084 --> 01:39.687
??Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ??

01:39.721 --> 01:43.025
??Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ??

01:43.059 --> 01:44.627
??The Earth began to cool ??

01:44.662 --> 01:47.164
??The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ??

01:47.198 --> 01:49.867
??We built the Wall ??
??We built the pyramids ??

01:49.901 --> 01:52.505
??Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ??

01:52.539 --> 01:54.440
??That all started
with a big bang ??

01:54.474 --> 01:55.476
??Bang! ??

01:55.477 --> 01:59.377
The Big Bang Theory 4x16
The Excelsior Acquisition
Original Air Date on March 1, 2010

01:59.378 --> 02:01.478
-- Sync, corrected by elderman Resync for 720p by Baqinardo --
-- for www.addic7ed.com --

02:04.502 --> 02:05.403
I can't decide

02:05.338 --> 02:06.604
whether I want Stan Lee
to autograph

02:06.639 --> 02:09.240
my Journey into Mystery 83,
first appearance of Thor

02:09.275 --> 02:11.076
or my Fantastic Four
number five,

02:11.110 --> 02:14.013
first appearance of Dr. Doom.

02:23.091 --> 02:25.326
Alex, I'm going to go
with what is...

02:25.360 --> 02:27.495
you're a dumbass?

02:32.501 --> 02:35.870
I've decided I'm going to
have Mr. Lee sign my copy

02:35.904 --> 02:37.906
of this month's Batman.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.040
That's crazy.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.076
Stan Lee had nothing
to do with Batman.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.544
Yes, which is why no one else
will ask him to sign one,

02:43.579 --> 02:46.647
and I will be the possessor
of a unique, albeit
confusing, artifact,

02:46.682 --> 02:50.184
which will set me apart from
hoi polloi of comic book fandom.

02:51.586 --> 02:53.020
That's a great idea.

02:53.055 --> 02:56.224
I'm going to get him
to sign a Batman as well.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.995
What is it about the word
"unique" you don't understand?

03:00.029 --> 03:01.430
Ow!

03:01.464 --> 03:02.564
Damn, paper cut.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.799
Nothing worse than a paper cut.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.002
Well, obviously you don't
remember your circumcision.

03:09.339 --> 03:11.841
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids
in my top desk drawer.

03:11.875 --> 03:15.144
Why don't you keep that stuff
in the bathroom?

03:15.178 --> 03:16.545
He does. And in the kitchen.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.781
And in the car.
And in his pocket.

03:18.815 --> 03:21.283
Yeah, but the ones in
my pocket are mine.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.487
Hi!
Hey.

03:24.521 --> 03:26.489
Guess who's going to be at the
comic bookstore on Thursday?

03:26.523 --> 03:28.291
Um... can you give me a hint?

03:28.325 --> 03:30.126
Stan Lee.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.128
Um... Stanley...

03:32.162 --> 03:34.364
Stanley... Stanley Tucci?

03:34.398 --> 03:35.899
No.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.235
No, Stan... Lee.

03:38.269 --> 03:40.671
Oh, oh, Stan Lee!

03:40.706 --> 03:43.541
Cool!

03:43.576 --> 03:45.977
You have no idea
who he is, do you?

03:46.011 --> 03:47.913
Of course I do.

03:47.947 --> 03:49.781
You're an important
part of my life

03:49.815 --> 03:52.284
and I pay attention to the
things you are interested in.

03:52.318 --> 03:53.951
Oh, good.

03:53.986 --> 03:55.319
Good.

03:55.354 --> 03:56.554
So, who's Stan Lee?

03:56.589 --> 03:59.991
Um... he was on Star Trek.

04:02.895 --> 04:04.529
Nope.

04:04.563 --> 04:06.665
Star Wars?
No.

04:06.699 --> 04:08.467
Um... uh, Stan Lee.

04:08.501 --> 04:11.936
Ooh, he was in those goofy
kung fu movies you love so much?

04:11.971 --> 04:14.539
That's Bruce Lee.

04:14.573 --> 04:15.740
Oh.

04:15.774 --> 04:18.610
So, is this Bruce Lee's
nerdy brother, Stan?

04:19.879 --> 04:22.280
Sheldon, why do you have
all these unopened

04:22.315 --> 04:23.916
paychecks in your desk?

04:23.950 --> 04:26.018
Because most of the things
I'm planning to buy

04:26.052 --> 04:28.620
haven't been invented yet.

04:28.654 --> 04:31.289
There-there must be thousands
of dollars here.

04:31.323 --> 04:33.025
Why don't you put it
in the bank?

04:33.059 --> 04:34.493
I don't trust banks.

04:34.527 --> 04:36.395
I believe that when
the robots rise up,

04:36.429 --> 04:39.064
ATMs will lead the charge.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.601
You've also got something

04:41.635 --> 04:43.570
from the Pasadena
Municipal Court.

04:43.604 --> 04:46.439
Undoubtedly another
snide response

04:46.474 --> 04:48.141
to my repeated letters
complaining

04:48.176 --> 04:49.809
that the flags in front
of the courthouse

04:49.843 --> 04:50.910
are flying in the wrong order.

04:50.944 --> 04:52.544
From left to right,
it's supposed to be

04:52.579 --> 04:55.380
federal, state,
and then city of Pasadena.

04:55.414 --> 04:58.583
I'm sorry. You sent more
than one letter about that?

04:59.551 --> 05:02.153
It bothers me.

05:03.722 --> 05:05.056
Sheldon, this is a summons.

05:05.090 --> 05:06.690
A summons for what?

05:06.725 --> 05:10.228
Looks like you ran a red light
on Marengo Avenue

05:10.262 --> 05:13.699
at 9:30 p.m.
on November 16.

05:13.733 --> 05:14.933
They got you
on a traffic camera.

05:14.968 --> 05:18.037
Nice picture.

05:21.341 --> 05:23.510
November 16?

05:23.544 --> 05:26.012
Penny, that's the evening
you fell in your bathtub

05:26.047 --> 05:28.148
and I had to drive you
to the emergency room.

05:28.182 --> 05:29.583
No, it isn't.

05:29.617 --> 05:31.251
Yes, it is.

05:31.286 --> 05:32.853
No, it isn't.

05:32.887 --> 05:34.388
Penny, I have an
eidetic memory.

05:34.422 --> 05:36.556
Also, that's a picture of
you in the passenger seat

05:36.591 --> 05:38.225
holding your dislocated
shoulder.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.561
Mmm, no, it isn't.

05:42.197 --> 05:45.700
Okay, then why is a summons
for a traffic violation

05:45.735 --> 05:48.236
committed in your car,
bearing your license plates,

05:48.271 --> 05:50.005
coming to me?

05:55.279 --> 05:56.646
Okay, look, they sent me
the ticket.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.880
I told them
I wasn't driving

05:57.915 --> 05:59.749
and they were all,
"If it wasn't you, who was it?"

05:59.783 --> 06:01.751
So you betrayed me?

06:01.785 --> 06:02.885
No!

06:02.920 --> 06:04.353
It wasn't a betrayal.

06:04.388 --> 06:07.023
It was more of a "I can't afford
any more points on my license."

06:07.057 --> 06:08.391
I already have
to buy my insurance

06:08.425 --> 06:10.860
from this place
in the Cayman Islands.

06:10.894 --> 06:13.429
But the only reason
I was driving your car

06:13.463 --> 06:16.399
was because you were in distress
and I was rescuing you.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.567
Yes, yes, look, and now

06:17.601 --> 06:20.402
you have a photo to remember
that heroic day.

06:21.171 --> 06:23.405
It's not that big a deal.

06:23.439 --> 06:25.640
You just go down to the court
on Thursday

06:25.675 --> 06:26.708
and you pay the fine.

06:26.742 --> 06:28.576
I'm not going
to pay a fine.

06:28.610 --> 06:30.111
That would imply
I'm guilty.

06:30.145 --> 06:31.747
You are guilty.

06:36.152 --> 06:39.088
That one I liked.

06:41.091 --> 06:42.124
I am not guilty.

06:42.159 --> 06:43.726
I only have a
learner's permit.

06:43.761 --> 06:44.961
Penny was the teacher.

06:44.995 --> 06:47.063
When the light turned yellow
she said "Go, go, go."

06:47.097 --> 06:49.833
So I went, went, went.

06:49.867 --> 06:50.934
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

06:50.968 --> 06:52.802
I'll be happy to reimburse you
for the fine.

06:52.837 --> 06:54.637
You know, as soon
as I get a part in a movie

06:54.671 --> 06:56.506
or my own TV series.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.042
You don't need to reimburse
me because I'm not paying.

06:59.076 --> 07:01.344
On Thursday, I will
have my day in court

07:01.379 --> 07:03.079
and justice will be done.

07:03.114 --> 07:06.316
In fact, I'm going to begin
preparing my defense right now.

07:07.918 --> 07:10.420
Okay, he's going to jail.

07:10.454 --> 07:12.489
Oh, that's right.

07:12.523 --> 07:14.624
Thursday is Stan Lee Day.

07:16.494 --> 07:18.628
Now you see what you've done?

07:19.864 --> 07:22.933
Because of you, we're all
going to miss Stan Lee.

07:22.967 --> 07:25.302
Whoa!

07:26.237 --> 07:27.837
What do you mean "all?"

07:27.871 --> 07:29.572
Well, you're my friends.

07:29.606 --> 07:32.108
You'll be standing
by my side, supporting me,

07:32.142 --> 07:33.609
feeding me
legal precedents,

07:33.644 --> 07:35.277
and if you had the
upper body strength,

07:35.312 --> 07:38.681
carrying me out on your
shoulders when I'm victorious.

07:39.616 --> 07:41.950
Yeah, okay. No.

07:41.984 --> 07:44.018
Are you saying that you
will not stand beside me

07:44.053 --> 07:45.487
as I plead my case?

07:45.521 --> 07:47.555
That's what I'm saying.

07:47.589 --> 07:48.957
Howard?

07:48.991 --> 07:49.991
Wow.

07:50.025 --> 07:52.961
Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court.

07:52.996 --> 07:54.997
Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice

07:55.031 --> 07:57.099
it would've been a much
shorter movie. No.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.034
Raj?

07:59.069 --> 08:00.335
You'll be there, won't you?

08:03.273 --> 08:05.641
All right, then.

08:05.675 --> 08:08.076
My so-called friends
have forsaken me.

08:08.111 --> 08:11.413
So, I guess it'll just be me
and my eyewitness.

08:11.447 --> 08:14.816
Oh, balls.

08:14.850 --> 08:16.084
Please try to wear something
appropriate.

08:16.118 --> 08:17.351
It won't help my case

08:17.385 --> 08:19.386
if the judge is busy trying
to read the word "Juicy"

08:19.421 --> 08:21.088
scrawled across your buttocks.

08:27.361 --> 08:28.828
Penny.

08:28.862 --> 08:30.229
Penny.

08:30.264 --> 08:32.365
Penny.

08:33.233 --> 08:35.668
That's just wrong.

08:35.703 --> 08:37.403
All right, let's go.

08:37.438 --> 08:38.438
Wait, hold on.

08:38.472 --> 08:40.106
Before we get to
the courthouse,

08:40.141 --> 08:43.110
I'd like to call on
your skills as an actress.

08:43.144 --> 08:44.411
What is this?

08:44.445 --> 08:45.579
I've taken the liberty

08:45.613 --> 08:47.515
of scripting your appearance
on the witness stand

08:47.549 --> 08:49.884
because, let's face it, you're
somewhat of a loose cannon.

08:49.918 --> 08:52.454
Now, don't worry; it's written
in your vernacular.

08:52.488 --> 08:53.855
So shall we rehearse?

08:53.890 --> 08:55.023
Do I have a choice?

08:55.058 --> 08:56.692
Well, of course
you have a choice.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.228
Although we live
in a deterministic universe,

08:59.263 --> 09:00.663
each individual has free will.

09:00.698 --> 09:02.699
Now, sit down.

09:02.734 --> 09:05.469
I call your attention

09:05.503 --> 09:07.471
to the events of November 16.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.906
Do you remember that date?

09:08.940 --> 09:12.576
"Darn tootin', I do.

09:13.745 --> 09:16.146
"If the court will excuse
my homespun,

09:16.180 --> 09:18.950
corn-fed Nebraskan
turn of phrase."

09:18.984 --> 09:21.152
That's excellent. Go on.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.621
"The reason that date is, like,

09:23.655 --> 09:26.057
"so totally fixed in my memory

09:26.091 --> 09:27.925
"is that I had the privilege
to be witness

09:27.959 --> 09:31.661
to one of the most heroic acts
I've ever seen in, like, ever."

09:33.430 --> 09:36.732
"And who performed
that heroic act?"

09:36.767 --> 09:38.367
"Why, you did, sir.

09:38.401 --> 09:40.670
"You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

09:40.704 --> 09:43.839
And may I add, it is
a privilege to know you."

09:45.175 --> 09:46.842
"There's no need
for compliments.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.811
This court is only interested
in the facts."

09:48.845 --> 09:52.781
"But it is a fact that
it's a privilege to know you.

09:52.815 --> 09:54.916
Totally."

09:56.152 --> 09:59.588
A teardrop rolls down my cheek?!

09:59.623 --> 10:01.057
Only a suggestion.

10:01.091 --> 10:03.526
A catch in your throat
would work just as well.

10:05.496 --> 10:07.464
"But it is a fact

10:07.498 --> 10:10.200
"that it's a privilege
to know you.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.369
Totally."

10:15.573 --> 10:18.574
Maybe you should put on
your "Juicy" pants again.

10:21.145 --> 10:22.645
Pay the cashier.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.548
Sheldon Cooper.

10:27.751 --> 10:29.685
Good morning, Your Honor.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.353
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

10:31.388 --> 10:33.055
appearing in pro se.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.257
That is to say,
representing himself.

10:35.292 --> 10:36.659
I know what it means.

10:36.693 --> 10:37.960
I went to law school.

10:37.995 --> 10:40.497
And yet you wound up
in traffic court.

10:41.732 --> 10:43.266
Anyway,

10:43.300 --> 10:44.434
if it would please the court,

10:44.468 --> 10:46.102
I'd like to begin
with an opening statement.

10:46.136 --> 10:47.236
The court would

10:47.271 --> 10:48.771
advise you to make it quick,

10:48.806 --> 10:51.541
as the court had a dicey-looking
breakfast burrito this morning

10:51.575 --> 10:53.443
and just took an Imodium.

10:54.478 --> 10:55.578
Very well.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.881
A quick opening statement.

10:57.916 --> 11:00.017
Like a milking stool,

11:00.051 --> 11:01.586
my case rests on

11:01.620 --> 11:02.821
three legs.

11:02.855 --> 11:04.189
I will demonstrate

11:04.223 --> 11:06.058
that I was improperly
instructed in driving

11:06.092 --> 11:08.461
by a woman whose lack of respect
for society

11:08.495 --> 11:09.929
borders on the sociopathic.

11:09.963 --> 11:11.830
I will argue

11:11.864 --> 11:14.266
that the emergency met
the legal doctrine

11:14.301 --> 11:16.335
of quod est necessarium
est licitum--

11:16.369 --> 11:18.571
that which is necessary
is legal.

11:18.605 --> 11:19.805
But first,

11:19.840 --> 11:21.741
I will raise
a Sixth Amendment issue.

11:21.775 --> 11:24.176
I'm unable
to confront my accuser,

11:24.211 --> 11:26.245
a non-human
entity, to wit,

11:26.280 --> 11:27.614
a camera.

11:27.648 --> 11:28.948
So, to sum up:

11:28.982 --> 11:29.983
improper instruction;

11:30.017 --> 11:32.018
quod est necessarium
est licitum;

11:32.053 --> 11:33.186
Sixth Amendment.

11:33.221 --> 11:35.088
My milk stool is complete.

11:35.123 --> 11:36.323
Impressive.

11:36.357 --> 11:37.023
Thank you.

11:37.057 --> 11:37.957
Guilty.

11:37.992 --> 11:39.926
Pay the cashier.

11:39.961 --> 11:41.261
I object.

11:41.295 --> 11:43.063
You're completely ignoring
the law.

11:43.097 --> 11:44.798
No, I'm following the law.

11:44.832 --> 11:46.633
I'm ignoring you.

11:46.668 --> 11:47.934
Really?

11:47.969 --> 11:51.337
I would point out that I am
at the top of my profession,

11:51.372 --> 11:54.240
while you preside
over the kiddy table of yours.

11:55.276 --> 11:57.310
Dr. Cooper,
before I find you in contempt

11:57.344 --> 12:00.481
and throw you in jail,
I'm going to give you a chance

12:00.515 --> 12:02.316
to apologize
for that last remark.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.017
I am a scientist.

12:04.051 --> 12:06.353
I never apologize for the truth.

12:12.795 --> 12:14.963
That's my spot.

12:29.811 --> 12:31.444
that start with the same letter.

12:31.479 --> 12:33.880
Oh, come on.
Why would you do that?

12:33.914 --> 12:35.915
Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,

12:35.950 --> 12:37.583
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange,

12:37.618 --> 12:39.251
Otto Octavius,
Silver Surfer,

12:39.286 --> 12:41.487
Peter Parker, oh,
and worst of all,

12:41.521 --> 12:46.159
J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.

12:46.193 --> 12:48.028
Okay, I'm cutting.

12:48.062 --> 12:51.732
I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee
after you cheese him off.

12:56.271 --> 12:57.605
Hey.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.040
Sheldon's in jail.

12:59.074 --> 13:00.375
Sheldon's in jail?!

13:00.409 --> 13:03.645
You called it.

13:03.679 --> 13:05.380
What do you think?
For what?

13:05.414 --> 13:07.481
For doing the same crap
he always does,

13:07.516 --> 13:08.849
except to a judge.

13:08.884 --> 13:11.718
He has to stay in there
until he apologizes.

13:11.753 --> 13:13.753
So tell him to apologize.

13:13.788 --> 13:15.088
Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.

13:15.122 --> 13:16.989
That didn't occur to me.

13:17.024 --> 13:18.624
If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,

13:18.658 --> 13:20.592
he is going to spend the night
in jail.

13:20.626 --> 13:22.961
Oh, no, that's terrible.

13:22.995 --> 13:24.962
Ooh, the line's moving.
Got to go. Bye.

13:34.673 --> 13:36.640
Excuse me?

13:36.675 --> 13:38.075
Excuse me, jailor?

13:39.010 --> 13:40.377
What?

13:40.411 --> 13:42.079
I need to use the restroom.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.880
Knock yourself out.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.851
That's the toilet?

13:48.886 --> 13:51.053
Well, it ain't
a wishing well.

13:52.522 --> 13:55.457
Please tell the judge
I'm ready to apologize.

13:58.227 --> 14:00.061
Look at that.

14:00.095 --> 14:02.129
"To my friend, Leonard.

14:02.164 --> 14:05.065
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"

14:06.502 --> 14:07.535
Awesome.

14:07.569 --> 14:09.570
Mine says,
"To my friend, Howard.

14:09.604 --> 14:12.339
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"

14:13.775 --> 14:16.777
Mine says,
"To Raj, from Stan Lee."

14:21.115 --> 14:23.316
That's 'cause you pissed him off
about his character names.

14:23.351 --> 14:24.584
Hey,

14:24.619 --> 14:27.487
I didn't even mention
Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin,

14:27.521 --> 14:29.255
Matt Murdock,
Pepper Potts,

14:29.290 --> 14:30.790
Victor Von Doom,

14:30.824 --> 14:32.825
oh, and worst of all,

14:32.860 --> 14:35.294
Millie the Model.

14:35.329 --> 14:37.129
We're home.

14:37.164 --> 14:38.998
Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?

14:39.032 --> 14:40.933
You know very well
how it went.

14:40.967 --> 14:44.102
Yeah, but we all want
to hear it from you.

14:46.473 --> 14:48.874
I was found guilty
and fined $533.

14:48.908 --> 14:51.310
I'm going to write you
a check for that.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.312
As long as you promise
to put it in your drawer

14:53.346 --> 14:56.683
and never cash it,
like the others.

14:58.186 --> 15:00.053
I also now have
three points

15:00.088 --> 15:02.723
on a driver's license
I do not yet possess,

15:02.757 --> 15:05.092
and I was forced
to issue an undeserved apology,

15:05.126 --> 15:07.094
simply because
I refuse to urinate

15:07.128 --> 15:11.164
in a stainless steel bowl
in front of criminals.

15:11.199 --> 15:13.834
Plus, you didn't get
to meet Stan Lee.

15:14.736 --> 15:16.403
Okay, that's enough, Howard.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.438
The poor guy's
had a tough time.

15:18.472 --> 15:20.840
He had to spend
the entire afternoon in jail

15:20.874 --> 15:22.909
wearing that suit.

15:22.943 --> 15:25.945
You're right,

15:25.980 --> 15:27.414
so it would be cruel to mention

15:27.448 --> 15:28.716
that after he finished
signing autographs,

15:28.750 --> 15:32.319
Stanley took Stuart and us out
for gelato.

15:33.155 --> 15:36.390
You had gelato
with Stan Lee?

15:36.425 --> 15:38.726
He said we could call him Stan.

15:39.694 --> 15:41.829
Except for Raj.

15:46.168 --> 15:48.803
Well, I hope you're
satisfied, Penny.

15:48.837 --> 15:50.137
You are responsible

15:50.172 --> 15:53.675
for all the evil that
has befallen me today.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.443
Okay, I realize that...
Not finished.

15:55.477 --> 15:56.845
It is because of you

15:56.879 --> 15:58.580
that I now have
a criminal record,

15:58.614 --> 16:00.949
and it is because of you
that I missed out

16:00.983 --> 16:02.684
on having gelato
with Stan Lee.

16:02.719 --> 16:04.987
Okay, maybe you'll have
another chance to have...
No, no.

16:05.021 --> 16:08.157
I will never have another chance
to have gelato with Stan Lee

16:08.191 --> 16:09.692
because
opportunities to have

16:09.727 --> 16:12.696
gelato with Stan Lee come
but once in a lifetime.

16:12.730 --> 16:17.368
"The moving finger writes,
and having writ, moves on!"

16:21.907 --> 16:26.178
Did he just somehow
give me the finger?

16:26.212 --> 16:27.779
Not just the finger.

16:27.813 --> 16:30.448
The moving finger.

16:32.818 --> 16:35.419
Hey, Stuart.

16:35.454 --> 16:38.122
Oh, hey, Penny.

16:38.157 --> 16:41.159
Wow. Hi.

16:41.193 --> 16:42.726
What's going on?
Nothing.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.263
I'm just getting ready to
close up and... head out.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.698
Ah.

16:47.732 --> 16:49.533
Cool. Got any fun plans?

16:49.568 --> 16:52.403
Oh, yeah. Big night tonight.

16:52.437 --> 16:55.073
Gonna share a can of tuna

16:55.107 --> 16:57.308
with the cat.

16:57.342 --> 16:59.343
Oh, nice.

16:59.377 --> 17:00.777
Not even my cat.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.546
I just feed it.

17:02.580 --> 17:05.716
Some nights it
doesn't even show up.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.184
Oh, okay.

17:07.219 --> 17:09.187
Well, I was hoping, um,

17:09.221 --> 17:10.555
you could do me a favor.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.956
Sure, yeah, name it.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.292
Well, I'm kind of responsible
for Sheldon missing Stan Lee,

17:14.326 --> 17:16.361
and I really want
to make it up to him.

17:16.395 --> 17:18.664
So I was hoping you could
give me his phone number

17:18.698 --> 17:20.332
so maybe I can arrange
for them to meet.

17:20.366 --> 17:22.601
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't
have his phone number.

17:22.635 --> 17:23.936
Hmm. Damn.

17:23.970 --> 17:25.303
Mm.
All right. Thank you.

17:25.338 --> 17:26.771
Mm-hmm.

17:26.805 --> 17:29.474
Wait.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.075
I have his address.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.510
Really?

17:32.544 --> 17:33.777
Great!

17:33.812 --> 17:36.880
But I can't give it to you.

17:36.915 --> 17:38.782
Then why did you tell me
you had it?

17:38.817 --> 17:41.618
I don't know.
Just chatting.

17:42.587 --> 17:43.855
You're looking at a guy

17:43.889 --> 17:45.689
who could very well
get stood up

17:45.724 --> 17:46.991
by a stray cat tonight.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.726
I'm sorry, Stuart.

17:48.761 --> 17:49.994
Thanks anyway.

17:50.029 --> 17:51.830
Mm-hmm.

17:51.864 --> 17:53.865
Wait.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.734
Yeah?

17:55.768 --> 17:57.503
Maybe we can make a deal.

17:57.537 --> 17:59.572
What kind of deal?

17:59.606 --> 18:01.541
I will give you the address

18:01.575 --> 18:04.644
if you go to my
cousin's wedding with me.

18:04.678 --> 18:06.045
You're extorting
a date out of me?

18:06.079 --> 18:07.112
I kind of have to.

18:07.147 --> 18:08.714
The cousin
who's getting married

18:08.748 --> 18:11.150
is the cousin I usually
go to weddings with.

18:11.184 --> 18:13.551
Can I bring Leonard?

18:13.585 --> 18:15.853
Sure. What the hell.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.154
Deal.

18:17.189 --> 18:19.323
We'll tell people
he's your cousin.

18:21.326 --> 18:23.760
This is Stan Lee's
front door.

18:23.795 --> 18:25.496
We were on Stan
Lee's curb,

18:25.530 --> 18:27.131
then we were on
Stan Lee's walk,

18:27.165 --> 18:28.766
and now we're
at Stan Lee's

18:28.801 --> 18:29.834
front door.

18:29.869 --> 18:31.803
Yup.

18:31.837 --> 18:34.273
Oh, Lord, you just rang
Stan Lee's doorbell.

18:34.307 --> 18:35.808
At Stan Lee's house.

18:35.842 --> 18:38.377
We're about to go in and have
milk and cookies with Stan Lee.

18:38.412 --> 18:40.513
Okay, sweetie, I don't know
if we're gonna have cookies,

18:40.547 --> 18:41.714
or he's just gonna say hi,

18:41.749 --> 18:43.583
or really what's gonna happen,
so just let me

18:43.618 --> 18:45.485
talk, and we'll... ?

18:45.519 --> 18:47.621
Yeah?

18:49.623 --> 18:51.157
Are you Stan Lee?

18:51.191 --> 18:53.893
Oh, damn.

18:53.927 --> 18:55.994
Hi. I'm Penny.
This is my friend, Sheldon.

18:56.029 --> 18:57.529
We're not friends
at the moment.

18:57.563 --> 18:58.864
Depends on
how this goes.

18:58.898 --> 19:00.732
Right, right. Anyway,

19:00.766 --> 19:02.800
Sheldon here is a huge fan
of yours, and he was supposed

19:02.835 --> 19:05.003
to meet you the other day
at the comic book store,

19:05.037 --> 19:09.141
but he kind of ended up in jail.

19:09.175 --> 19:10.409
I see. And you thought

19:10.443 --> 19:13.178
you'd just come over
to my house uninvited?

19:13.213 --> 19:15.114
You said we
were invited.

19:15.148 --> 19:16.816
Oh, no, no, I said
I'm inviting you

19:16.850 --> 19:18.718
to come with me
to Stan Lee's house.

19:20.154 --> 19:22.822
You know,
you fan boys are unbelievable.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.123
Do you think
you can just

19:24.158 --> 19:26.559
ring my doorbell
any time you want?

19:26.593 --> 19:28.594
I mean, why don't you
just come on in

19:28.629 --> 19:30.129
and watch the Lakers game
with me?

19:30.163 --> 19:33.032
Well, I'm not much
of a sports fan,

19:33.067 --> 19:35.235
but thank you.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.537
I'm sorry.

19:37.572 --> 19:39.539
He doesn't really
understand sarcasm.

19:39.574 --> 19:42.142
Well, I'll give him something
he'll understand.

19:42.176 --> 19:43.810
Joanie, call the police!

19:43.844 --> 19:45.745
Nice to meet you.

19:51.516 --> 19:54.018
Fantastic Four,
Daredevil,

19:54.052 --> 19:55.553
Invincible Iron Man,

19:55.588 --> 19:57.389
Happy Hogan,
Curt Connors...

19:57.423 --> 19:59.191
Would you just let it go?

19:59.225 --> 20:03.363
And worst of all,
Fin Fang Foom.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.968
Hey, where've you been?

20:08.002 --> 20:09.636
I'll tell you where I've been.

20:09.671 --> 20:12.839
You boys may have had gelato
with Stan Lee

20:12.873 --> 20:14.273
and gotten
autographed comics,

20:14.308 --> 20:16.375
but I saw the inside
of his house

20:16.409 --> 20:18.610
and got an autographed
application

20:18.645 --> 20:21.680
for a restraining order.

20:22.914 --> 20:24.650
Sweet.

20:25.084 --> 20:28.253
Plus, I get to hang out
with him again at the hearing.

20:30.987 --> 20:32.654
This is going
to look great hanging next

20:32.689 --> 20:34.723
to my restraining order
from Leonard Nimoy.

20:34.759 --> 20:37.793
