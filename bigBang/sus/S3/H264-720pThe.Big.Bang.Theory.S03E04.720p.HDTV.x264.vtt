WEBVTT

00:04.274 --> 00:06.794
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

00:07.331 --> 00:08.306
What do you mean?

00:08.358 --> 00:09.960
The instructions are very clear:

00:10.074 --> 00:11.817
"don't feed the gremlins
after midnight. "

00:13.544 --> 00:15.369
"don't get the gremlins wet. "

00:18.145 --> 00:19.391
How hard is that?

00:20.217 --> 00:21.770
(door opening)

00:22.004 --> 00:23.064
Hi, guys.

00:23.186 --> 00:24.136
Hi, honey.

00:24.228 --> 00:25.031
Hey.

00:25.107 --> 00:26.372
Ooh, we're "honey" now, are we?

00:26.466 --> 00:29.083
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal,

00:29.135 --> 00:31.606
Penny has upgraded his
designated term of endearment,

00:31.702 --> 00:34.421
Thus distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie,"

00:34.473 --> 00:37.180
Usually in an attempt to soften
a thinly-veiled insult.

00:38.685 --> 00:40.547
You're boring people,
sweetie.

00:42.297 --> 00:44.704
Although, sometimes,
she omits the veil entirely.

00:45.825 --> 00:47.472
So, what are
you guys doing?

00:47.550 --> 00:49.177
Celebrating
Columbus day.

00:49.248 --> 00:51.542
<i>We're watching goonies, gremlins
and young sherlock holmes. </i>

00:52.483 --> 00:54.746
They're all written
by Chris Columbus.

00:56.603 --> 00:57.660
Okay.

00:57.719 --> 00:59.588
What do you watch
on thanksgiving?

00:59.650 --> 01:01.009
The parade.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.212
Oh, you know,
that reminds me...

01:04.271 --> 01:05.939
I usually go back to
Nebraska for thanksgiving,

01:06.012 --> 01:07.251
But this year they're
calling it off

01:07.293 --> 01:08.922
On account of my
brother's trial.

01:09.022 --> 01:11.037
What's he on trial for?

01:11.117 --> 01:12.918
Oh, just a big
misunderstanding.

01:12.987 --> 01:14.547
You know, you'd actually
like my brother.

01:14.592 --> 01:15.964
He's kind of
a chemist.

01:19.529 --> 01:20.997
Anyway, I was thinking
I'd have thanksgiving here,

01:21.057 --> 01:22.456
And you are all invited.

01:22.545 --> 01:23.820
Oh. I'll be there.

01:23.888 --> 01:25.604
Will you be serving
cranberry jelly

01:25.656 --> 01:27.167
Or cranberry sauce?

01:28.022 --> 01:29.643
I guess I could
serve both.

01:29.737 --> 01:32.514
You guess? I don't seem to
have much of a handle on this.

01:35.070 --> 01:37.251
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year,

01:37.287 --> 01:39.796
My mother has all the
relatives over and cooks up

01:39.835 --> 01:41.508
Her famous tur-briska-fil.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.448
Tur-briska-fil?

01:44.524 --> 01:47.256
Turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.505
It's not as good as it sounds.

01:53.412 --> 01:54.526
Raj, what about you?

01:54.610 --> 01:56.703
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

02:01.611 --> 02:02.866
All right, this year,
you don't have to

02:02.927 --> 02:04.663
Eat the
tur-briska-fil.

02:05.752 --> 02:06.571
(chuckles)

02:06.659 --> 02:07.730
I don't even chew it.

02:07.808 --> 02:09.091
I swallow it like pills.

02:37.582 --> 02:38.803
So, what's going on
with Raj?

02:39.319 --> 02:40.765
Well, the good news is,

02:40.885 --> 02:43.228
He has no problem
with my mother's tur-bruska-fil.

02:44.708 --> 02:45.984
Hard to believe,
but go on.

02:47.349 --> 02:49.996
The bad news is,
he says he's getting deported.

02:50.288 --> 02:51.134
<i>Leonard:</i>
What do you mean,

02:51.205 --> 02:52.164
He's getting deported?

02:52.235 --> 02:53.496
I believe it means
that the U.S. Government

02:53.531 --> 02:55.178
Is going to expel him
from the country.

02:56.229 --> 02:57.671
He could then either return
to his native India,

02:57.743 --> 03:00.083
Emigrate to another country
that's willing to accept him

03:00.179 --> 03:02.735
Or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

03:06.692 --> 03:07.905
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

03:10.647 --> 03:11.785
Penny, would you mind
stepping outside

03:11.842 --> 03:13.104
So we can speak to him?

03:13.175 --> 03:14.922
(groans)
fine.

03:14.968 --> 03:17.654
But the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

03:17.755 --> 03:19.978
Another reason to consider a
life of piracy.

03:20.154 --> 03:22.408
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

03:25.817 --> 03:26.648
Okay, she's gone.

03:31.532 --> 03:33.725
Sorry.
I lost my cool.

03:35.470 --> 03:37.035
So, what's going on?

03:37.108 --> 03:38.725
Okay, here's the deal:

03:38.832 --> 03:40.830
Six months ago, my
research testing

03:40.905 --> 03:43.434
The predicted composition
of trans-neptunian objects

03:43.474 --> 03:45.079
Ran into a dead end.

03:45.132 --> 03:47.150
So?
So, my visa's only good as long as

03:47.219 --> 03:50.375
I'm employed at the university.
And when they find out at I've got squat,

03:50.421 --> 03:51.579
They're going to cut me off.

03:52.372 --> 03:54.723
By the way, when I say squat,
I mean diddly-squat.

03:56.317 --> 03:58.191
I wish I had squat.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.332
So, wait, what have you been
doing for the past six months?

04:02.380 --> 04:04.275
You know, checking e-mail,

04:05.374 --> 04:06.658
Updating my facebook status,

04:07.476 --> 04:09.264
Messing up wikipedia entries.

04:11.595 --> 04:12.875
Hey, did you know netflix

04:12.936 --> 04:14.414
Lets you stream movies
on your computer now?

04:15.156 --> 04:17.131
And you've continued
to take the University's money

04:17.222 --> 04:18.740
Under false pretenses?

04:18.818 --> 04:20.907
Highly unethical
for an astrophysicist.

04:21.782 --> 04:23.304
Although practically mandatory
for a pirate.

04:25.976 --> 04:27.212
I don't want to go back
to India.

04:27.305 --> 04:30.846
It's hot and loud,
and there's so many people.

04:32.748 --> 04:34.776
You have no idea...
they're everywhere.

04:36.330 --> 04:38.112
Okay, guys, think.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.690
How do we keep Raj
in the country?

04:44.490 --> 04:46.910
<i>Penny:</i>
Why doesn't he just get another job?

04:53.180 --> 04:54.414
What are you
asking me for?

04:54.466 --> 04:56.599
I don't know if you
can talk now or not.

05:02.412 --> 05:03.207
Oh, beef...

05:03.343 --> 05:05.104
I'm going to miss
you so much.

05:07.163 --> 05:08.346
Do you know,
at the mumbai mcdonald's,

05:08.433 --> 05:09.828
You can't get a big mac?

05:09.932 --> 05:12.097
All you can get
is a chicken maharaja mac.

05:13.086 --> 05:14.303
And the special sauce...

05:14.420 --> 05:16.498
Curry... which, in india,
believe you me,

05:16.562 --> 05:17.854
Is really not that special.

05:19.606 --> 05:21.545
Don't worry,
you'll find another job.

05:21.619 --> 05:23.313
Yeah let me start
practicing for it.

05:23.348 --> 05:25.271
"do you want fries with
that maharaja mac?"

05:27.094 --> 05:28.305
<i>Sheldon:</i>
Hi, Leonard.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.407
Hello, Raj.

05:29.516 --> 05:30.869
Hello, Sheldon.

05:31.755 --> 05:34.811
Forgive me, as you know, I'm no
adept at reading facial cues,

05:34.872 --> 05:36.289
But I'm going
to take a stab here:

05:36.402 --> 05:38.869
You're either sad or nauseated.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.293
I'm sad.

05:41.352 --> 05:42.408
I was going to say sad.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.784
I don't know why I hedged.

05:45.927 --> 05:46.763
What are you eating?

05:46.833 --> 05:49.861
Elbow macaroni with ground
hamburger and tomato sauce.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.812
Oh, beefaroni.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.115
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.093
I've always been
a little confused about this.

05:57.169 --> 05:58.779
Why don't hindus eat beef?

05:58.830 --> 06:00.221
We believe cows are gods.

06:00.256 --> 06:01.188
Not technically.

06:01.307 --> 06:03.626
<i>In hinduism, cattle are
thought to be like god. </i>

06:03.816 --> 06:05.963
Do not tell me about
my own culture, Sheldon!

06:06.010 --> 06:08.205
In the mood I'm in, I'll take
you out... I swear to cow!

06:11.116 --> 06:12.378
I'm sorry.

06:12.504 --> 06:13.789
Me, too.

06:13.886 --> 06:15.245
I'm just...
I'm a little on edge.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.030
Understandable.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.303
Your entire life seems
to be crumbling around you,

06:18.400 --> 06:19.957
And your future
appears bleak at best.

06:20.019 --> 06:22.651
Thank you.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.326
And you're wrong
about hinduism and cows.

06:25.904 --> 06:27.589
Hey, Raj, guess what.

06:27.673 --> 06:29.110
Professor Laughlin
is looking for someone to join

06:29.178 --> 06:30.806
The stellar evolution
research team.

06:30.890 --> 06:35.323
You-you're kidding! That's fantastic! I know! What
are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.249
I'm on it.

06:36.735 --> 06:37.858
That's happy, right?

06:37.954 --> 06:38.910
Yeah.
Nailed it.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.211
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

06:43.279 --> 06:45.012
I was surprised to hear
you were interested

06:45.082 --> 06:46.442
In joining our little team.

06:46.767 --> 06:49.059
Giving up on those
trans-neptunian objects, are we?

06:49.148 --> 06:51.023
No, no; it's a very
promising area.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.609
In a perfect world I'd spend several
more years on it.

06:53.696 --> 06:55.290
But I just couldn't pass up
the opportunity

06:55.385 --> 06:57.521
To work with you
on your tremendously exciting

06:57.596 --> 07:00.154
And not yet conclusively
disproved hypothesis.

07:01.084 --> 07:01.920
Splendid.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.336
Uh, please sit down.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.994
Can I offer you
a sherry?

07:05.061 --> 07:06.659
It's a little
early, isn't it?

07:06.715 --> 07:08.499
Not on proxima centauri.

07:08.547 --> 07:09.614
(chuckles)

07:09.662 --> 07:10.817
(laughing):
That's very good.

07:10.923 --> 07:13.031
Jolly amusing,
but if you don't mind,

07:13.124 --> 07:15.312
I'll hold off
until sunset on titan.

07:16.509 --> 07:17.242
(laughs)
well done.

07:17.288 --> 07:18.554
I have a feeling you're going

07:18.610 --> 07:20.205
To fit in just fine,
Dr. Koothrappali.

07:20.299 --> 07:21.357
Thank you, sir.

07:21.436 --> 07:22.552
(knock at door)

07:23.349 --> 07:24.091
I'm sorry.

07:24.181 --> 07:25.291
Am I late?

07:25.346 --> 07:26.430
No, no, no.
Right on time.

07:26.508 --> 07:28.147
Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present

07:28.191 --> 07:30.037
Dr. Millstone from MIT.

07:30.114 --> 07:32.275
She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

07:32.378 --> 07:34.404
It's nice to meet you,
Dr. Koothrappali.

07:35.795 --> 07:38.745
I read your paper on kuiper belt
object size distribution.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.714
I really enjoyed it.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.194
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

07:47.305 --> 07:50.888
Well, I ran a simulation
that allowed me

07:50.952 --> 07:53.118
To correct for the
observational efficiency.

07:53.192 --> 07:55.160
That's just fascinating.

07:55.485 --> 07:56.335
Thank you.

07:58.163 --> 08:01.064
Would you like to hear
more about it in my hot tub?

08:05.658 --> 08:06.888
So, when do I start?

08:11.140 --> 08:12.592
What do you mean you
didn't get the job?

08:12.662 --> 08:13.742
How could you
not get it?

08:14.617 --> 08:17.879
You know... He's british;
I'm indian.

08:18.709 --> 08:21.095
Ever since Gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

08:22.530 --> 08:24.867
Wait, are you saying that
he discriminated against you?

08:24.942 --> 08:26.318
Because we should
file a complaint.

08:26.427 --> 08:27.387
That's okay.

08:27.482 --> 08:28.976
A complaint has been filed.

08:31.471 --> 08:32.162
So, that's it.

08:32.286 --> 08:33.847
That was my last hope.

08:33.927 --> 08:35.361
I'm going
to be deported,

08:36.028 --> 08:37.063
Sent home in disgrace,

08:37.127 --> 08:40.303
Exposed to the sardonic barb
of my cousin sanjay.

08:40.362 --> 08:42.864
Or, as you may know him,
dave from at&t customer service.

08:50.199 --> 08:51.142
I'm really going
to miss you.

08:51.214 --> 08:52.974
Will you come visit me
in India?

08:54.336 --> 08:56.198
Gee, that's, like,
a 17-hour flight.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.695
How about I meet
you halfway?

08:58.809 --> 09:00.951
Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of japan.

09:01.706 --> 09:03.502
Tell you what,
we'll skype.

09:07.556 --> 09:08.456
Gentlemen.

09:08.524 --> 09:09.719
<i>Leonard:</i>
Hey, Raj,

09:09.785 --> 09:11.681
Did you get the job
with professor laughlin?

09:11.747 --> 09:13.608
No.
I assumed as much.

09:13.702 --> 09:14.690
But never fear.

09:14.798 --> 09:16.320
Like the subordinate
male protagonist

09:16.398 --> 09:17.787
In countless action movies

09:17.841 --> 09:19.969
Who disappears half way
through the second reel,

09:20.037 --> 09:21.952
I have returned to save the day.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.671
Odd.

09:26.731 --> 09:28.169
Usually, he's met by cheers.

09:29.126 --> 09:29.915
Anyway,

09:29.962 --> 09:31.109
I was thinking about exploring

09:31.204 --> 09:32.533
The string theory implications

09:32.603 --> 09:35.104
Of gamma rays from
dark matter annihilations,

09:35.173 --> 09:36.602
And it occurred to me
that I could benefit...

09:36.666 --> 09:37.528
Excuse me, Sheldon.

09:37.601 --> 09:39.288
How many reels before
the subordine male protagonist

09:39.343 --> 09:40.834
Gets to his point?

09:40.908 --> 09:42.786
I'm sorry... if you didn't
cheer at my entrance,

09:42.876 --> 09:44.222
It's too late
to buy into the premise.

09:47.452 --> 09:49.252
Anyway, I got
some extra money

09:49.347 --> 09:50.686
From the head of
the department,

09:50.762 --> 09:53.006
And Raj can come
work for me.

09:54.356 --> 09:55.435
<i>You want me
to work with you?</i>

09:56.327 --> 09:57.546
<i>For me. </i>

09:58.403 --> 09:59.577
You're going to
have to listen

09:59.658 --> 10:01.133
More carefully when
you're on the job.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.609
Ay, uh, please don't take this
the wrong way,

10:04.670 --> 10:07.686
But I'd rather swim buck-naked
across the ganges

10:07.805 --> 10:09.286
With a paper cut on my nipple

10:10.038 --> 10:12.000
And die a slow,
agonizing death

10:12.062 --> 10:14.449
From a viral infection
than work with you.

10:16.451 --> 10:17.645
<i>For me. </i>

10:25.634 --> 10:26.480
(knock at door)

10:28.444 --> 10:29.508
Sheldon, are you busy?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.562
Of course I'm busy.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.538
Shall I wait?
Yes, please.

10:48.107 --> 10:49.320
How may I help you?

10:51.096 --> 10:53.755
I've reconsider your offer
to let me work with you.

10:53.852 --> 10:55.482
<i>For me</i>

10:56.643 --> 10:58.077
<i>Yes, for you. </i>

10:58.176 --> 11:00.356
I do, however, have
a few conditions.

11:00.435 --> 11:01.944
First, at all times,

11:02.048 --> 11:04.071
I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

11:04.153 --> 11:06.018
Second, my contributions
shall be noted

11:06.086 --> 11:07.225
In all published material.

11:07.281 --> 11:09.401
And third, you are never allowed
to lecture me

11:09.472 --> 11:11.332
On hinduism
or my indian culture.

11:13.213 --> 11:14.575
I'm impressed, Raj.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.018
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

11:17.362 --> 11:18.259
Thank you.
I reject them all.

11:20.869 --> 11:22.232
Then you leave me no choice.

11:22.344 --> 11:23.872
I accept the job.

11:25.697 --> 11:28.113
I'm sorry, I believe
you've misunderstood.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.886
I'm not giving you the job.

11:29.971 --> 11:33.083
I'm simply affording you
the opportunity to apply for it.

11:35.553 --> 11:37.277
Have a seat; we'll get started
with the interview.

11:37.379 --> 11:39.556
Wha... You're kidding!

11:40.367 --> 11:41.231
Please.

11:43.177 --> 11:44.118
(sighs)
all right.

11:44.247 --> 11:46.490
(annoyed sigh)

11:46.581 --> 11:48.239
So... (sighs)

11:50.704 --> 11:53.204
That's what you wear
to an interview?

11:54.867 --> 11:56.800
Come on, dude,
we've been friends for years.

11:56.872 --> 11:59.017
Oh, pulling strings, are we?

12:00.563 --> 12:03.298
Sheldon, for god's sakes,
don't make me beg.

12:03.955 --> 12:05.435
Bazinga!

12:06.471 --> 12:07.772
You've fallen victim

12:07.847 --> 12:10.104
To another one
of my classic practical jokes.

12:12.491 --> 12:14.972
I'm your boss now.
You may want to laugh at that.

12:19.311 --> 12:22.206
Ah, nice having the
place to ourselves, isn't it?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.333
Uh-huh.

12:23.666 --> 12:25.001
Now that Raj is
working for Sheldon,

12:25.094 --> 12:26.722
I don't have to chauffeur
him around anymore.

12:26.845 --> 12:28.832
Plus, yeah, with them
working late so much,

12:28.892 --> 12:30.291
We get some privacy.

12:30.367 --> 12:31.419
Mm-hmm.

12:33.107 --> 12:36.089
Hey, want to get a little crazy?

12:36.874 --> 12:38.042
What are you thinking?

12:38.320 --> 12:41.035
Let's slide over to
Sheldon's spot a make out.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.159
You are a dirty girl.

12:48.678 --> 12:49.701
(knocking on door)

12:49.779 --> 12:51.176
Oh, god, how did he know?

12:52.171 --> 12:53.360
Hello.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.581
Hi, Howard.
(wry laugh)

12:55.669 --> 12:56.977
Am I interrupting?

12:57.088 --> 12:58.569
Little bit, yeah.

12:58.725 --> 13:00.243
Guess I should have called.

13:00.372 --> 13:01.608
Yeah, maybe.

13:01.720 --> 13:02.928
(sighs)

13:03.057 --> 13:04.926
(clicking tongue)

13:09.839 --> 13:12.150
Tonight's the night
I usually go line dancing

13:12.262 --> 13:13.873
With Raj at the Palomino.

13:15.119 --> 13:16.549
Uh-huh.

13:17.312 --> 13:18.761
But he's working with Sheldon.

13:18.852 --> 13:20.053
Yes, we know.

13:21.004 --> 13:22.337
Want me to leave?

13:23.300 --> 13:24.553
You know, whatever.

13:25.496 --> 13:27.292
Okay, I guess I can hang
for a little while.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.231
So what are we watching?

13:32.004 --> 13:33.773
<i>Sex and the city.
Yikes. </i>

13:33.905 --> 13:36.764
Hey, I happen
to love this movie.

13:36.799 --> 13:38.177
Fine, let's watch it.

13:38.659 --> 13:41.494
Maybe all our periods
will synchronize.

13:46.122 --> 13:48.236
All right, we're going to
be designing an experiment

13:48.370 --> 13:50.101
To look
for the annihilation spectrum

13:50.204 --> 13:52.334
Resulting from dark matter
collisions in space.

13:53.064 --> 13:54.621
Ooh, dark matter.

13:54.705 --> 13:56.242
We better bring
a flashlight.

13:56.319 --> 13:57.865
(chuckles)

13:59.577 --> 14:00.819
I was making a joke.

14:00.865 --> 14:02.010
I'm the boss.

14:02.069 --> 14:03.358
I make the jokes.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.173
Sorry
go ahead and make your joke.

14:07.270 --> 14:08.789
This is not the
time for joking.

14:10.293 --> 14:11.615
We're doing
serious research,

14:11.714 --> 14:13.479
Which requires complete
and utter focus.

14:13.592 --> 14:15.801
All right,
let's buckle down and work.

14:16.437 --> 14:18.325
("Eye of the tiger"
by Survivor playing)

14:46.548 --> 14:47.869
Sheldon.
What?

14:47.927 --> 14:48.992
I need an aspirin.

14:49.079 --> 14:50.109
Top desk drawer.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.674
Thank you.
Alright?

14:58.730 --> 14:59.791
Yes.
Good.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.210
("Eye of the tiger" resumes)

15:08.613 --> 15:09.824
That was fun.

15:10.511 --> 15:11.498
Thank you.

15:11.595 --> 15:13.412
Leonard, honey, you don't
have to say thank you

15:13.480 --> 15:14.804
Every time we have sex.

15:14.883 --> 15:16.328
Oh. Okay.

15:17.165 --> 15:19.341
Tomorrow you're going to
get a card in the mail.

15:19.392 --> 15:20.660
Just throw it away.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.571
(clattering)

15:24.109 --> 15:26.099
(in irish brogue):
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

15:29.030 --> 15:30.581
What are you doing here?

15:30.686 --> 15:33.121
Well, usually, on Sundays,
I go with Raj

15:33.199 --> 15:35.516
To scam on hippie chicks
at the farmers market,

15:35.620 --> 15:38.496
But he's still working
with Sheldon,

15:38.570 --> 15:39.776
So I thought I'd come over here

15:39.887 --> 15:41.563
And make you guys
scrambled eggs and salami.

15:47.727 --> 15:50.210
Oh, kill me.

15:50.277 --> 15:53.068
By the way, I couldn't help
overhearing your big finish.

15:53.122 --> 15:54.644
Bravo, Leonard.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.912
See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me,"

15:59.982 --> 16:01.209
I wouldn't have had to
hear that. (stammers)

16:02.193 --> 16:03.349
What do you guys think?

16:03.419 --> 16:04.539
Want to take
in a matinee,

16:04.603 --> 16:05.847
Maybe go
rollerblading,

16:05.905 --> 16:06.957
Catch a step class?

16:08.109 --> 16:09.678
Do something.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.800
Okay.

16:10.853 --> 16:13.241
Um, Howard, we
need to talk.

16:13.323 --> 16:15.041
Sure. 'sup, Holmes?

16:16.289 --> 16:18.437
Uh... Please understand

16:18.537 --> 16:20.670
That it's not that we
don't want you around,

16:20.753 --> 16:23.139
But Penny and I
occasionally need some...

16:24.504 --> 16:25.429
Alone time.

16:27.077 --> 16:27.843
Oh.

16:29.417 --> 16:32.254
I- I get it, I'm the third wheel.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.245
(chuckles)

16:33.334 --> 16:34.745
Sorry, I should have seen that.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.138
I'll get out
of your way.

16:39.050 --> 16:39.778
Uh, you're gonna want

16:39.854 --> 16:41.497
To eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

16:41.586 --> 16:42.706
Thank you.

16:44.238 --> 16:47.321
There's lox and cream cheese
in the fridge.

16:47.394 --> 16:49.835
The bagels are in the oven,
I was...  warming them up.

16:51.935 --> 16:54.719
Great.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.971
I'm just going to hang out
with my mom

16:57.017 --> 16:58.300
That's always fun

16:59.956 --> 17:01.110
Good.

17:08.406 --> 17:09.849
Are we terrible people?

17:09.913 --> 17:10.840
I don't know.

17:11.618 --> 17:12.582
What do you
want me to do?

17:12.649 --> 17:14.142
(stammers)

17:14.253 --> 17:16.180
G- get him;
bring him back.

17:16.224 --> 17:17.846
Are you sure?

17:17.934 --> 17:20.610
Yeah.
Okay.

17:20.965 --> 17:21.879
Howard come back.

17:21.951 --> 17:23.768
Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

17:27.845 --> 17:28.872
No, no, no, no!

17:28.932 --> 17:30.028
That rate is much too low

17:30.099 --> 17:31.526
From what we'd expect
from this collision.

17:31.602 --> 17:32.448
Do you understand

17:32.543 --> 17:33.500
We're talking
about dark matter

17:33.586 --> 17:35.272
Colliding in outer space?

17:35.340 --> 17:36.663
Of course I understand.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.888
<i>And who are you to tell me
about outer space?</i>

17:38.936 --> 17:40.339
I'm the astrophysicist.

17:40.533 --> 17:41.758
"astro" means "space. "

17:43.088 --> 17:44.415
"astor" means "star. "

17:45.841 --> 17:47.198
Okay, well, let
me just tell you,

17:47.286 --> 17:48.491
If we were having
this argument

17:48.553 --> 17:50.502
In my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.808
<i>English is
your native language. </i>

17:56.408 --> 17:58.460
Okay, you got me there, but
you're wrong about this!

17:59.630 --> 18:01.950
There is a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

18:02.035 --> 18:03.981
Unfortunately you have to be
a visionary to see it.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.799
My god, you think
that every thought

18:07.905 --> 18:09.694
That comes out of your
head is pure gold.

18:09.779 --> 18:10.871
Well, let me tell
you something.

18:10.947 --> 18:12.557
Some of those thoughts
are pure caca.

18:12.643 --> 18:13.622
Caca?!

18:14.459 --> 18:15.505
It means "doo-doo."

18:15.581 --> 18:16.850
All right!

18:17.494 --> 18:18.876
First of all,
Dr. Koothrappali,

18:18.961 --> 18:20.671
When I first proposed
that you work with me..

18:20.743 --> 18:22.590
Aha! So I am
working with you.

18:22.671 --> 18:24.973
In this context,
"with me" means "for me."

18:25.865 --> 18:26.928
Ah, well, in
this context...

18:27.042 --> 18:29.154
Oh!

18:30.052 --> 18:31.796
If I'm wrong,
prove it.

18:31.894 --> 18:32.985
Okay.

18:33.104 --> 18:36.792
Here's where we derive the mass
of the dark matter particle.

18:37.415 --> 18:38.908
You've misstated the
atomic weight of the target.

18:39.012 --> 18:40.402
Let me finish.
You're defacing work.

18:40.488 --> 18:42.142
I'm not defacing it,
I'm fixing it.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.898
Give me the eraser.
No.

18:43.989 --> 18:45.455
I said give it to me.

18:45.532 --> 18:47.141
Come and get it.

18:48.608 --> 18:49.875
Fine.

18:53.419 --> 18:54.592
Oh, Lord.

18:56.865 --> 18:58.074
Dr. Koothrappali,

18:58.147 --> 19:00.707
As your superior, I forbid you
from writing on my board!

19:00.770 --> 19:02.166
You are not my superior.

19:02.256 --> 19:03.646
I am in every way.

19:03.701 --> 19:04.642
Oh, yeah?

19:04.725 --> 19:05.844
Can you do this?

19:10.899 --> 19:12.118
Nice working with you.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.300
<i>I'm sorry... for you. </i>

19:40.432 --> 19:41.121
Raj...

19:41.400 --> 19:43.732
Raj... Raj...

19:46.357 --> 19:47.184
I'm busy.

19:47.470 --> 19:48.347
Doing what?

19:52.022 --> 19:53.382
All right,
you've made your point.

19:53.446 --> 19:54.570
What do you want, Sheldon?

19:54.668 --> 19:55.928
I looked over the board

19:56.008 --> 19:57.464
And it turns out
you were right.

19:58.221 --> 19:59.723
So you were wrong.
I didn't say that.

19:59.805 --> 20:01.053
That's the only
logical inference.

20:01.145 --> 20:02.491
Nevertheless,
I didn't say it.

20:04.094 --> 20:06.847
Anyway, I would like you to come
back and work for me.

20:06.963 --> 20:08.978
<i>For you or with you?</i>

20:10.006 --> 20:13.074
In this context "for me"
could mean "with me. "

20:13.563 --> 20:14.705
All right, but I have
some conditions.

20:14.763 --> 20:16.149
I reject them all.
I'll take the job.

20:18.098 --> 20:19.323
See you Monday.

20:19.439 --> 20:22.021
Wait, you have
to drive me home.

20:22.107 --> 20:23.518
How did you get here?
I walked.

20:23.649 --> 20:24.754
So walk home.
I can't.

20:24.830 --> 20:26.456
There's a big dog outside.

20:31.717 --> 20:33.488
On the way home,
we can start thinking

20:33.552 --> 20:35.252
About methods
of optimizing the detector

20:35.336 --> 20:37.305
For 500 gev particles.

20:37.352 --> 20:38.482
All right.

20:38.563 --> 20:41.687
