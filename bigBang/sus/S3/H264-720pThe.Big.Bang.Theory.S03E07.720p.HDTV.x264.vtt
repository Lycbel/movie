WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:04.800
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe
you made up your own game.

00:08.802 --> 00:11.802
It's like the slogan says,
"The Physics is theoretical,

00:11.867 --> 00:13.767
but the fun is real."

00:14.233 --> 00:17.300
We must not be playing it right.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.834
All right, five.

00:19.901 --> 00:22.434
One, two, three, four, five.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.767
Oh, wow, look at that.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.500
My Department of Defense
research grant is renewed.

00:26.567 --> 00:28.500
Oh! Great roll!

00:28.567 --> 00:31.467
Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron

00:31.534 --> 00:34.334
and build the large
Hadron Collider.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.334
Yay.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.934
You're a natural
at this, Penny.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.834
And as the first beta testers,
you two'll have quite the edge

00:41.900 --> 00:44.201
when we play with Wolowitz
and Koothrappali on Sunday.

00:44.267 --> 00:46.167
Oh, gee, Sheldon,

00:46.234 --> 00:48.600
I don't think we can play
on Sunday.

00:48.667 --> 00:49.468
Why not?

00:49.534 --> 00:51.401
Because of the reasons

00:51.468 --> 00:52.600
that Penny will now tell you.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.034
Penny?

00:54.351 --> 00:56.718
Actually, I have to pick up my
friend Justin from the airport.

00:56.784 --> 00:59.184
There you go-- she has to
pick up her friend Justin
at the airport.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.484
And I can't play 'cause
I'm going with her-- right?

01:02.551 --> 01:03.818
Um, yeah, if you want.

01:03.883 --> 01:05.250
I mean, there may not be room.

01:05.317 --> 01:08.017
He's got a lot of stuff--
like guitars and amplifiers.

01:08.084 --> 01:09.217
Wait.

01:09.217 --> 01:10.917
What are you talking about?

01:10.983 --> 01:11.117
My friend, Justin.

01:11.184 --> 01:12.250
Pay attention,
Leonard.

01:12.317 --> 01:14.517
That's why she can't
play on Sunday.

01:14.584 --> 01:15.817
Who is this Justin?

01:16.084 --> 01:17.251
Your turn, Leonard.
I told you about him.

01:17.268 --> 01:18.834
No, you didn't.
Roll the dice, Leonard.

01:18.901 --> 01:20.933
Yeah-- my friend from Omaha;
plays the guitar.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.834
Anyway, he's coming to L.A.
looking for some session work,

01:22.901 --> 01:24.600
so I told him he could
just crash on my couch

01:24.667 --> 01:25.801
for a few weeks.

01:25.867 --> 01:26.467
Come on, Leonard--
if you roll a six,

01:26.467 --> 01:28.600
Penny dies horribly in
a nuclear meltdown.

01:29.801 --> 01:32.667
See what I mean when I
say the fun is real?

01:33.234 --> 01:34.634
Hang on.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.867
Some guy is going to be sleeping
on your couch?

01:36.934 --> 01:38.201
He's not "some guy."

01:38.267 --> 01:39.434
He's my friend.

01:39.501 --> 01:42.634
So by "friend,"
do you mean "friend friend,"

01:42.700 --> 01:44.501
"gay friend,"
or "ex boyfriend

01:44.501 --> 01:45.767
"who you're now platonic with

01:45.833 --> 01:48.034
but still might have a thing
for you friend"?

01:48.500 --> 01:51.167
Well, he's definitely not gay.

01:51.233 --> 01:53.267
Oh, ho-ho, a definitely
not gay musician

01:53.334 --> 01:55.233
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.233
Yippee.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.334
Okay, we went out a little bit,
a long time ago.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.400
But we were never
like "going out."

02:02.467 --> 02:04.667
Okay, not to be pedantic,
but last I checked

02:04.734 --> 02:07.200
"went out" was in fact the past
tense of "going out"--

02:07.267 --> 02:08.267
which I think
we all know

02:08.334 --> 02:09.901
is a popular euphemism

02:09.968 --> 02:11.934
for "saw each other naked."

02:12.901 --> 02:15.601
I'll just roll for you.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.968
Do you have a problem
with Justin staying with me?

02:18.034 --> 02:19.534
What was your first clue?

02:19.601 --> 02:21.567
Uh-oh!
Industrial accident.

02:22.901 --> 02:23.968
You know what?

02:24.034 --> 02:25.467
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

02:25.534 --> 02:26.934
I'm not talking to you
like you're an idiot!

02:27.001 --> 02:28.801
I'm saying the whole idea
is idiotic!

02:28.867 --> 02:31.100
"You accidentally stare
at a helium-argon laser.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.801
Lose one turn and a retina."

02:33.867 --> 02:35.934
How is that not talking
to me like I'm an idiot?

02:36.001 --> 02:37.734
It's my friend,
it's my couch,

02:37.801 --> 02:38.734
and it's my freakin' life!

02:38.801 --> 02:40.634
It's also your roll.

02:40.701 --> 02:42.500
You know what?
It is your life.

02:42.567 --> 02:45.867
If you want to have some stupid guitarist
stay on your couch, then fine.

02:45.934 --> 02:47.667
Why don't you just rent

02:47.734 --> 02:50.233
some bun beds and invite
The Black Eyed Peas?!

02:50.300 --> 02:52.867
Hey, if I want to invite the
entire lineup of Lollapalooza

02:52.934 --> 02:54.467
to sleep in my apartment,
I will,

02:54.534 --> 02:55.667
and it's none of your business!

02:55.734 --> 02:56.767
Are you listening to yourself?

02:56.834 --> 02:58.200
Do you know how childish
you sound right now?

02:58.267 --> 02:59.334
Oh, now I'm a child?

02:59.400 --> 03:00.834
Well, at least
I'm not an idiot anymore!

03:00.901 --> 03:02.534
(blender grinding)
The two aren't mutually
exclusive!

03:02.601 --> 03:04.167
Oh, you are such a--

03:04.233 --> 03:06.167
What the hell is he doing?!

03:06.233 --> 03:07.400
He's drowning us out.

03:07.467 --> 03:08.901
He doesn't like fighting.

03:08.968 --> 03:10.867
Sheldon, just stop!
ok, the fight is over!

03:10.934 --> 03:12.601
Oh, and FYI,

03:12.667 --> 03:14.400
you never even heard
of The Black Eyed Peas

03:14.434 --> 03:15.367
until you met me!

03:15.434 --> 03:17.434
I heard of 'em!

03:18.567 --> 03:20.968
Didn't know they were a band.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.001
(grinding continues)

03:22.468 --> 03:23.533
Sheldon, she's gone.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.900
You can turn off the blender.

03:31.301 --> 03:35.034
Has your relationship reached
its inevitable ugly end?

03:36.067 --> 03:38.734
No, we just had a little spat.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.401
Look on the bright side.

03:40.434 --> 03:42.368
As the result
of Penny's forfeit,

03:42.401 --> 03:46.134
you have become the world's
first winner of "Research Lab."

03:46.201 --> 03:49.134
Would you like
a commemorative snow cone?

03:50.667 --> 03:54.167
* Our whole universe
was in a high, dense state *

03:57.434 --> 03:58.934
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago*
The Earth began to cool t! *

03:59.001 --> 04:01.667
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

04:01.734 --> 04:04.134
<i>* We built the Wall
* We built the pyramids *</i>

04:04.201 --> 04:06.767
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery*

04:06.834 --> 04:08.667
*hat all started
with a big bang *

04:08.734 --> 04:10.234
<i>* Bang! *</i>

04:19.258 --> 04:21.357
I don't get how she
can just announce

04:21.423 --> 04:23.791
that an old boyfriend is going
to be sleeping on her couch.

04:23.857 --> 04:26.357
Hey, I thought of a game
we can play in the car.

04:26.423 --> 04:27.824
I don't want to play a game,
Sheldon.

04:27.891 --> 04:29.057
It's called "Scientists."

04:29.124 --> 04:31.091
Now, I will name
three scientists,

04:31.158 --> 04:32.657
then you will put them in order

04:32.724 --> 04:33.991
of the size of their
contribution

04:34.057 --> 04:35.057
to their respective fields.

04:35.124 --> 04:37.024
To make this game
even more compelling,

04:37.091 --> 04:39.158
you must consider
only the contribution

04:39.224 --> 04:40.423
of the man to the field,

04:40.490 --> 04:42.690
not the validity
of the field itself.

04:42.757 --> 04:45.158
For example:
Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn

04:45.224 --> 04:48.290
made a greater contribution to
the discredited field of alchemy

04:48.357 --> 04:50.557
than Halbert Vanderplatt made
to neurobiology.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.191
Okay, ready to have some fun?

04:53.957 --> 04:56.191
An old boyfriend
who's definitely not gay.

04:56.258 --> 04:59.057
That's what a guy likes
to hear-- "definitely."

04:59.124 --> 05:00.857
All right, I'll start
with an easy one:

05:00.924 --> 05:05.423
Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie
and Niels Bohr.

05:05.490 --> 05:08.158
And then I say one little thing
and I end up being the bad guy!

05:08.224 --> 05:11.423
Hint: Madame Curie had
her husband to help her.

05:11.490 --> 05:12.924
What am I supposed to say?

05:12.991 --> 05:15.323
"Sure, Penny, I'm cool
with your old boyfriend

05:15.390 --> 05:16.757
sleeping in your
apartment."

05:16.824 --> 05:18.924
"Well, Leonard, it doesn't
matter if you're cool or not

05:18.991 --> 05:20.224
"because I'm Penny
and I'm pretty

05:20.290 --> 05:22.091
and I can do whatever
the hell I want!"

05:22.758 --> 05:23.957
"Oh, I get it!

05:24.023 --> 05:25.624
"You think you're doing me
a favor just by

05:25.691 --> 05:26.858
being in a relationship
with me!"

05:26.923 --> 05:28.391
"No, no, Leonard!
I'm doing you a favor

05:28.457 --> 05:29.858
just by being in the
same room as you!"

05:29.923 --> 05:31.224
Leonard! Stop the car!

05:32.224 --> 05:33.324
What?

05:33.391 --> 05:36.457
I can't listen to the
two of you fight anymore.

05:41.557 --> 05:42.758
Come on, come on,
we're late.

05:42.824 --> 05:44.257
Calm down.
We'll make the movie.

05:44.290 --> 05:45.824
I believe my alarm
is appropriate,

05:45.890 --> 05:46.858
given the situation.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.090
The movie starts
in 17 minutes,

05:48.157 --> 05:49.923
which means we'll need
to make all the lights

05:49.990 --> 05:52.391
on Colorado Boulevard,
plus skip the concession stand,

05:52.457 --> 05:53.758
and preshow urination.

05:53.824 --> 05:56.691
Oh, dude, I wish
you had said something

05:56.758 --> 05:59.290
before pounded
that last Red Bull.

05:59.357 --> 06:01.391
SHELDON: Go, go,
Power Rangers, go!

06:05.023 --> 06:05.957
Hey.

06:06.023 --> 06:06.591
Hey.

06:06.957 --> 06:08.524
We're, uh, going to the movies.

06:08.590 --> 06:09.724
No, we're not.

06:10.824 --> 06:11.791
We're standing
in the hallway,

06:11.857 --> 06:13.524
suffering through
an awkward encounter.

06:15.590 --> 06:16.457
Hang on.

06:17.124 --> 06:19.557
<i>They're showing a new digital
part of Time Bandits.</i>

06:19.624 --> 06:20.957
You wouldn't want to come,
would you?

06:21.024 --> 06:22.557
Not really, no.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.357
All right, invitation
pointlessly offered,

06:24.424 --> 06:25.823
invitation declined
as expected,

06:25.890 --> 06:26.957
everyone's civil,
nobody's fighting.

06:27.024 --> 06:28.024
Have a nice evening.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.890
Just give us a minute.

06:31.957 --> 06:33.923
Oh, take all the time
you need.

06:37.857 --> 06:40.823
So, are we going to talk
about last night?

06:40.890 --> 06:42.658
Are you ready to apologize?

06:42.724 --> 06:43.758
No.

06:43.857 --> 06:44.758
(imitates buzzer)
Wrong answer.

06:44.823 --> 06:45.758
But thank you for playing.

06:46.023 --> 06:47.924
Oh, come on.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.090
This is stupid.

06:49.157 --> 06:50.123
Oh, there it is again!

06:50.190 --> 06:51.190
You think I'm stupid!

06:51.257 --> 06:52.324
No, there's a difference

06:52.390 --> 06:54.023
between being stupid
and acting stupid.

06:54.090 --> 06:55.224
Oh, yeah? well,
there's a difference

06:55.290 --> 06:57.090
between being a jerk
and being an ass!

06:57.157 --> 06:59.324
No, there isn't!

06:59.390 --> 07:01.557
They're synonyms!

07:03.257 --> 07:06.023
Well, that was
rather unpleasant.

07:06.024 --> 07:09.324
Yeah, I don't think I need my preshow urination anymore.

07:12.225 --> 07:14.125
Leonard, when that woman moved in
three years ago

07:14.157 --> 07:15.757
I told you not to talk to her,
and now look.

07:15.824 --> 07:17.290
we're going to be late
for the movies.

07:21.224 --> 07:24.724
<i>Hey! Look! Amazing
Spider-Man 183.</i>

07:24.791 --> 07:26.824
Got it.

07:26.891 --> 07:27.891
Remember this one?

07:27.958 --> 07:29.224
Spider-Man loses a big fight

07:29.290 --> 07:31.724
and then his girlfriend
breaks up with him.

07:31.791 --> 07:34.123
Hmm.

07:34.190 --> 07:35.757
Want me to get it for you?

07:35.824 --> 07:38.624
It'll help take your mind
off things.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.290
Hey, guys. What's going ?

07:40.357 --> 07:41.958
Oh, we need to kill
a couple hours

07:42.023 --> 07:43.157
<i>till the next showing
of Time Bandits.</i>

07:43.224 --> 07:44.190
Oh, well,

07:44.257 --> 07:45.290
no problem.

07:45.357 --> 07:47.123
I was thinking of closing early
and going home,

07:47.190 --> 07:48.591
but let's face it,

07:48.657 --> 07:50.390
that's just a slightly
smaller lonely room

07:50.457 --> 07:53.324
filled with comic books.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.023
Thanks, Stuart.

07:56.990 --> 07:58.224
Let me ask you something.

07:58.290 --> 07:59.291
Do you think it's okay for Penny

07:59.358 --> 08:01.091
to have an ex-boyfriend sleep
on her couch?

08:01.157 --> 08:02.790
No, I mean, she's obviously
way out of line.

08:02.857 --> 08:03.790
Thank you!

08:03.857 --> 08:05.157
But if she dumps you,

08:05.224 --> 08:06.690
she'll have a new boyfriend
by tomorrow morning

08:06.757 --> 08:07.857
and you'll have
a new girlfriend

08:07.924 --> 08:09.857
when you figure out
how to build one.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.890
So the only question is:
how long until you fold?

08:14.957 --> 08:16.690
I am not going to fold.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.057
Well, excuse me,
I don't think

08:18.124 --> 08:19.358
Penny's out of
line at all.

08:19.424 --> 08:20.757
You don't own her.

08:20.824 --> 08:22.557
It's like my girl, Beyonce says

08:22.623 --> 08:26.091
"If you like it, you shoulda
put a ring on it."

08:26.157 --> 08:27.424
WOLOWITZ:
Come on.

08:27.490 --> 08:28.623
At the very least,

08:28.690 --> 08:30.458
when she found out Leonard
was upset about it,

08:30.523 --> 08:31.690
she should've
backed off.

08:31.757 --> 08:32.957
You mean like
when a guy's upset

08:33.024 --> 08:34.623
because his friend agreed to
take a cooking class with him

08:34.690 --> 08:35.824
and then doesn't show up

08:35.890 --> 08:38.324
because he's doing a juice fast
with his mother?

08:38.391 --> 08:41.590
I didn't know you were
upset about that.

08:41.657 --> 08:43.624
Really! Did you miss all
the subtle indicators,

08:43.691 --> 08:45.624
like me saying,
"Howard, I am upset."

08:45.691 --> 08:46.891
Okay, sorry.

08:46.957 --> 08:48.290
Maybe it means something
different in this country.

08:48.357 --> 08:51.257
Back in India, it means you're
upset with a guy named Howard!

08:51.323 --> 08:53.357
I said I'm sorry.

08:53.424 --> 08:54.624
Sorry doesn't make up
for the fact

08:54.691 --> 08:56.657
that I had to make chicken
and rice with this vegan guy.

08:56.724 --> 08:58.657
Do you know what vegan
chicken and rice is?

08:58.724 --> 09:00.691
Rice!

09:00.757 --> 09:02.657
Yeah, well, you think
I was having fun,

09:02.724 --> 09:04.624
sitting around all night
listening to my mother say,

09:04.691 --> 09:07.924
"Have you ever peed so much
in your life?"

09:07.991 --> 09:10.857
Oh, my God, you are
such a mama's boy.

09:10.924 --> 09:12.991
WOLOWITZ:
Hey, don't bring my mother
into this!

09:13.058 --> 09:14.290
You brought your
mother into this!

09:14.357 --> 09:16.357
Stop it,
both of you.

09:16.424 --> 09:18.090
All this fighting,
I might as well

09:18.157 --> 09:20.057
be back with my parents!
"Damn it, George,

09:20.124 --> 09:22.357
I told you if you didn't quit
drinkin' I'd leave you!"

09:22.424 --> 09:24.157
"Well, I guess that
makes you a liar.

09:24.224 --> 09:25.957
'Cause I'm drunk as hell
and you're still here!"

09:26.024 --> 09:27.124
"Stop yelling!

09:27.191 --> 09:28.757
You're making Sheldon cry!"

09:28.823 --> 09:30.558
"I'll tell you
what's making Sheldon cry!

09:30.624 --> 09:32.391
That I let you name him
Sheldon."

09:39.157 --> 09:42.124
Boy, what got him so upset?

09:42.191 --> 09:45.124
Oh, sure, you can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

09:52.823 --> 09:54.857
Oh, thank you
very much.

09:54.924 --> 09:56.291
Come back soon.

09:56.357 --> 09:57.857
With the other half of my tip.

09:59.723 --> 10:01.624
(sighs)

10:01.690 --> 10:02.457
Hey, Sheldon.

10:02.524 --> 10:03.957
What are you doing here?

10:04.024 --> 10:05.124
This is a restaurant.

10:05.191 --> 10:06.258
It's lunchtime.

10:06.323 --> 10:07.624
I would think, as a waitress,

10:07.690 --> 10:09.024
you'd be familiar
with the paradigm.

10:09.091 --> 10:10.191
Is Leonard coming?

10:10.258 --> 10:12.158
No, I believe
Leonard is waiting

10:12.224 --> 10:14.857
for you to come crawling back
to him and apologize.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.091
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.590
I assumed that would
be your attitude.

10:17.657 --> 10:19.124
Hence, my true purpose in coming here.

10:19.191 --> 10:22.524
Which is?
I want you to crawl
back to him and apologize.

10:22.590 --> 10:23.524
I'm busy.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.490
Excuse me, miss.

10:25.557 --> 10:27.924
I'd like to order lunch.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.057
Fine. What do you want?

10:33.124 --> 10:34.657
I have a few questions.

10:34.724 --> 10:37.657
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half-sandwich?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.057
Yes.

10:39.124 --> 10:41.457
Where exactly does
the half-sandwich come from?

10:41.491 --> 10:43.724
Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich,

10:43.791 --> 10:45.224
or do I have to wait

10:45.290 --> 10:46.524
for someone else
in the restaurant

10:46.591 --> 10:47.758
to order the other half?

10:47.824 --> 10:50.023
No, no, Sheldon, they
just make a half-sandwich.

10:50.090 --> 10:51.858
You can't make
a half-sandwich.

10:51.923 --> 10:53.858
If it's the half
of a whole sandwich,

10:53.923 --> 10:55.457
it's just
a small sandwich.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.091
Okay, fine, it's soup
and a small sandwich.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.523
Is that what you want?

10:59.590 --> 11:01.657
Of course not.
I'll have my usual.

11:01.690 --> 11:02.924
Great.

11:02.991 --> 11:05.490
Aren't you going to ask me
if I want a beverage?

11:05.557 --> 11:06.824
Don't you usually get lemonade?

11:06.891 --> 11:08.024
Yes.
Do you want lemonade?

11:08.091 --> 11:09.291
Yes.
Anything else?

11:09.358 --> 11:11.091
Yes-- I want you
to apologize to Leonard.

11:11.157 --> 11:14.091
I am not going
to apologize.

11:14.157 --> 11:14.858
I've done nothing wrong.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.457
He is completely
overreacting.

11:16.523 --> 11:17.023
Irrelevant.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.290
The disruption
in your relationship

11:18.357 --> 11:19.758
is making my life intolerable.

11:19.824 --> 11:22.657
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but
this really isn't about you.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.524
I don't follow.

11:25.591 --> 11:27.724
Yeah, yeah, I'll
be right there.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.291
Look, Sheldon,
I have to go.

11:29.358 --> 11:31.258
<i>All right, let's assume,
ad argumentum,</i>

11:31.324 --> 11:33.091
that in this case,
Leonard is wrong.

11:33.157 --> 11:34.624
<i>Leonard is wrong.</i>

11:34.690 --> 11:36.057
Considering the number
of transgressions

11:36.124 --> 11:37.891
you've committed
that he's overlooked,

11:37.957 --> 11:39.324
don't you think that,
just this once,

11:39.390 --> 11:40.358
you could return the favor?

11:40.423 --> 11:41.390
I'm coming.

11:41.457 --> 11:42.557
Good-bye, Sheldon.

11:42.624 --> 11:44.590
(sighs)

11:47.691 --> 11:50.524
What do you mean,
transgressions
I've committed?

11:50.591 --> 11:51.823
Were you under the impression

11:51.890 --> 11:53.823
that Leonard has
no complaints about you?

11:53.890 --> 11:55.424
Like what?!
Yeah, yeah, I see you.

11:55.491 --> 11:57.357
You're making a little
check sign in the air.

11:57.424 --> 11:58.957
I got it.
Just hold your horses.

12:00.024 --> 12:01.190
What does Leonard
complain about?

12:01.257 --> 12:02.658
Your driving.

12:02.724 --> 12:04.724
The plethora
of stuffed animals on your bed

12:04.790 --> 12:07.057
that stare at him
during your amorous activities.

12:09.091 --> 12:11.323
Your constant tardiness,
your singing.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.290
My singing?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.757
That's actually from my list.

12:13.824 --> 12:15.590
But Leonard would be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

12:15.657 --> 12:17.690
Okay, if Leonard has so
many problems with me,

12:17.757 --> 12:19.357
why hasn't he
just said so?

12:19.423 --> 12:20.390
Because, according to him,

12:20.457 --> 12:21.557
you're oversensitive
and have a temper.

12:21.624 --> 12:22.724
Oh, really?

12:22.791 --> 12:24.124
Well, then, do me a favor

12:24.191 --> 12:26.524
and tell Leonard that
he can drop dead!

12:30.024 --> 12:33.124
And she wonders why
she's constantly undertipped.

12:37.991 --> 12:38.624
Hey.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.191
Oh, good, you're home.

12:40.258 --> 12:41.224
I need you to
do me a favor.

12:41.290 --> 12:42.357
Sure.

12:42.423 --> 12:43.490
Go apologize to Penny.

12:44.057 --> 12:45.291
What?!

12:45.357 --> 12:46.557
Right now would be good.

12:46.624 --> 12:48.190
(loud knocking)
PENNY: Leonard!

12:48.257 --> 12:50.557
Although, a few minutes ago
would have been better.

12:50.624 --> 12:51.990
PENNY:
I hear you don't like

12:52.057 --> 12:55.324
my stuffed animals,
my driving or my punctuality.

12:55.324 --> 12:57.557
What? Who would tell you
something like that?

12:57.624 --> 12:59.957
Why would you tell her
something like that?

13:00.024 --> 13:01.391
It doesn't matter
why he told me.

13:01.457 --> 13:02.891
It's true, isn't it?

13:02.957 --> 13:04.158
Okay, yeah, it's true,

13:04.224 --> 13:05.690
but I can live
with that stuff.

13:05.757 --> 13:07.891
What I can't live with is
you casually informing me

13:07.957 --> 13:10.057
that some guy's going to be
staying in your apartment

13:10.124 --> 13:11.224
without even
asking me first!

13:11.290 --> 13:12.457
That isn't even your problem!

13:12.524 --> 13:14.258
Your problem is
you don't trust me!

13:14.323 --> 13:14.923
Oh, come on.

13:15.024 --> 13:18.257
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say
that I don't trust Penny?

13:18.324 --> 13:21.324
Sheldon?
Where did he go?

13:21.391 --> 13:22.524
PENNY:
Oh, your yelling

13:22.591 --> 13:23.890
must have
freaked him out again.

13:23.890 --> 13:24.990
Where are you going?!

13:25.057 --> 13:25.724
You just walk away

13:25.790 --> 13:27.057
in the middle
of an argument?!
No.

13:27.124 --> 13:28.423
I'm going
to go find your damn roommate

13:28.490 --> 13:29.557
before he hurts himself

13:29.624 --> 13:30.824
trying to cross the street
or something!

13:30.891 --> 13:32.824
Why didn't you say so?

13:32.891 --> 13:35.157
Oh, now I need your
permission for that, too?!

13:35.224 --> 13:36.891
Well, I can't
read your mind, Penny!

13:36.957 --> 13:38.057
Really? Why not?

13:38.124 --> 13:39.690
You're so smart,
and I'm so dumb!

13:42.224 --> 13:43.358
Raj?

13:44.358 --> 13:45.523
Raj?

13:45.590 --> 13:46.857
Raj?

13:46.924 --> 13:48.557
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Stop knocking!
It's open!

13:48.624 --> 13:51.523
Please tell my parents that
our dark matter research

13:51.590 --> 13:53.790
is at a critical juncture,
and I can't come home

13:53.857 --> 13:54.991
for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.

13:54.991 --> 13:56.024
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI:
Sheldon,

13:56.091 --> 13:57.891
ask our son what
we're supposed to say

13:57.957 --> 13:59.724
to Mr. and Mrs. Cheldry,
whose daughter, Lakshmi

13:59.790 --> 14:02.490
is flying in from London, for
the sole purpose of meeting him.

14:02.557 --> 14:04.291
I didn't ask you
to set me up with Lakshmi.

14:04.358 --> 14:05.757
You should be thanking us!

14:05.824 --> 14:08.423
Yes-- Lakshmi just got
her stomach stapled.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.624
You have an opportunity
to get in good with her

14:12.691 --> 14:14.758
before she loses weight,
and her self-esteem goes up.

14:14.824 --> 14:16.190
I don't care!

14:16.257 --> 14:17.858
And why don't you
think I can find

14:17.923 --> 14:18.758
a woman for myself?

14:18.824 --> 14:19.923
Because you're 27,

14:19.990 --> 14:22.090
and the closest thing
we have to a daughter-in-law

14:22.157 --> 14:23.657
is that Jewish boy Howard.

14:23.724 --> 14:26.957
Oh..that is completely
below the belt.

14:27.023 --> 14:29.858
Sheldon, tell my parents that
Howard and I are just friends.

14:31.491 --> 14:33.057
Sheldon?

14:33.124 --> 14:35.290
Howard and I are just friends!

14:38.324 --> 14:41.491
Fine. I'll come home
for Sanjay's wedding.

14:42.824 --> 14:45.023
(sighs)

14:45.090 --> 14:46.691
(shouting):
Sheldon?!

14:46.758 --> 14:47.957
(whistling)

14:50.023 --> 14:51.857
What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.557
Hey, why don't you
just let me find him

14:54.624 --> 14:56.923
while you sit there
hitting your imaginary brake?

14:56.990 --> 14:58.691
The brake
might be imaginary,

14:58.758 --> 15:00.858
but that stop sign
you just ran wasn't.

15:00.923 --> 15:02.057
What stop sign?

15:02.124 --> 15:04.957
Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!

15:12.057 --> 15:13.624
(doorbell rings)

15:13.691 --> 15:15.391
MOTHER: Howard,
answer the door!

15:15.457 --> 15:17.857
I'm busy!

15:18.124 --> 15:19.457
WOLOWITZ: I'm busy too.

15:19.523 --> 15:20.724
You answer it.

15:20.790 --> 15:21.757
MOTHER:
I can't!

15:21.824 --> 15:23.358
I'm on the toilet!

15:23.423 --> 15:26.191
WOLOWITZ:
For God's sake, I don't
need to hear that!

15:26.258 --> 15:28.624
Can't you just
say, "I'm busy"?

15:28.690 --> 15:29.991
MOTHER:
I said I'm busy,

15:30.057 --> 15:32.091
but that wasn't
good enough for you!

15:32.157 --> 15:33.258
WOLOWITZ:
You know what?

15:33.324 --> 15:35.324
I hope it's one of those
home invasion deals,

15:35.325 --> 15:36.325
And they shove me in the head.

15:37.024 --> 15:38.690
MOTHER: Well, if it's
a home invader,

15:38.757 --> 15:41.124
don't tell them
I'm on the toilet!

15:45.191 --> 15:47.224
There's no one there.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.724
You're hearing things,
you crazy old lady!

15:54.024 --> 15:55.791
Hey, Stuart,
have you seen Sheldon?

15:55.858 --> 15:58.657
Yeah, he's, uh, over in
the graphic novel section.

16:00.391 --> 16:02.357
Built himself a little nest.

16:02.424 --> 16:04.190
Thank you.

16:04.257 --> 16:05.190
Uh, Penny?

16:05.257 --> 16:06.224
Yeah?

16:06.290 --> 16:07.624
Is everything okay?

16:07.691 --> 16:08.624
What do you mean?

16:08.691 --> 16:09.758
Uh, Sheldon told me

16:09.824 --> 16:11.224
you and Leonard
were having a fight?

16:11.290 --> 16:13.257
Oh, yeah, kind of.

16:13.290 --> 16:14.457
It's-It's no big thing.

16:14.524 --> 16:15.624
Oh, good, good.

16:15.991 --> 16:17.957
I love you.

16:19.724 --> 16:22.158
I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

16:22.223 --> 16:23.390
All right,
what's going on?

16:23.424 --> 16:25.424
It's a little hard to explain.
He does this thing

16:25.424 --> 16:27.290
where he pretends
he's in an alternate

16:27.357 --> 16:29.891
dimension that occupies the
same physical space we're in,

16:29.957 --> 16:31.924
but he can't perceive us.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.590
Don't flatter yourself.

16:34.657 --> 16:36.424
I'm just ignoring you.

16:37.990 --> 16:39.723
Come on, Sheldon,
let's go home.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.491
Look, we're
done fighting.

16:41.558 --> 16:42.723
I've heard that before.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.524
But then,
the next thing you know,

16:44.591 --> 16:45.857
I'm hiding in my bedroom,

16:45.924 --> 16:47.191
blaring a Richard Feinman
lecture

16:47.257 --> 16:49.723
while my mom is shouting
that Jesus would forgive her

16:49.790 --> 16:52.057
if she put ground glass
in my dad's meatloaf.

16:52.124 --> 16:53.757
And my dad's

16:53.823 --> 16:55.224
on the roof skeet-shooting

16:55.291 --> 16:57.690
her Franklin Mint
collectible plates.

16:58.757 --> 17:00.357
There's going to
no more shouting

17:00.424 --> 17:02.424
and no skeet-shooting.

17:02.490 --> 17:03.590
Really?

17:03.657 --> 17:05.457
Where's your friend Justin
going to sleep?

17:05.524 --> 17:07.824
Yeah... where's
he gonna sleep?

17:07.891 --> 17:09.957
Oh, my God, would
you let this go?!

17:10.024 --> 17:11.424
STUART:
I'd let it go.

17:13.091 --> 17:14.457
Why should I let it go?

17:14.524 --> 17:16.924
Why don't you just tell the guy
to find another place to sleep?!

17:16.991 --> 17:18.624
(robot playing
ominous music)

17:18.691 --> 17:20.557
Oh, for God's sakes.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.190
(turns robot off)

17:22.257 --> 17:24.290
So, you have childhood issues.

17:24.357 --> 17:26.623
We all have childhood issues.

17:26.690 --> 17:29.291
At some point, you just need
to grow up and get past them.

17:29.358 --> 17:30.557
ROBOT:
Fire! Fire!

17:30.623 --> 17:31.824
(robot firing blasters)

17:31.890 --> 17:33.557
Leonard, will you just
let me handle this, please?

17:34.757 --> 17:36.590
Again! Fire! Fire!
Let... just...Look...

17:36.657 --> 17:38.623
(robot shouting)

17:39.957 --> 17:42.157
(turns robot off)

17:42.224 --> 17:44.924
Sheldon, please,
try and understand.

17:44.991 --> 17:47.224
Look, Leonard and I
are in a relationship,

17:47.291 --> 17:48.824
and occasionally,
we're going to fight.

17:48.890 --> 17:50.557
But no matter
what happens

17:50.623 --> 17:53.057
between us, we will
always love you.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.858
Right, Leonard?

17:56.924 --> 17:59.357
Always is a long time.

18:00.424 --> 18:03.257
Sure. Always.

18:03.324 --> 18:05.190
You know, how about
we buy you this robot,

18:05.257 --> 18:07.624
and then we all go home?

18:07.691 --> 18:09.691
I want that one.

18:10.691 --> 18:12.390
Okay, you can have that one.

18:12.457 --> 18:15.724
Oh, come on, he's just going
to play with it twice,

18:15.790 --> 18:18.991
and then it'll end up in his
closet with all the other junk.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.191
Buy him the robot, Leonard.

18:23.191 --> 18:25.024
Can I get
this comic book, too?

18:25.091 --> 18:26.358
(baby talk):
Yes, you can.

18:30.257 --> 18:31.557
(sighs)

18:31.623 --> 18:33.523
We meet again.

18:42.257 --> 18:44.157
So what did Justin say
when you told him

18:44.224 --> 18:45.590
he couldn't sleep
on your couch?

18:45.657 --> 18:46.824
He's a musician.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.424
He'll sleep in his own
vomit, if he has to.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.324
I should have asked
for much more

19:00.391 --> 19:04.157
than a comic book and a robot.

19:04.224 --> 19:06.224
