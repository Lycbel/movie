WEBVTT

00:03.234 --> 00:04.134
Seems like forever,

00:04.135 --> 00:06.436
since the four of us have
been out to eat, you know?

00:06.504 --> 00:07.937
Just the guys.

00:08.005 --> 00:09.272
Oh, God! Yes, we get it.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.175
You have a girlfriend now.

00:12.242 --> 00:13.710
A little jealous, are we?

00:13.777 --> 00:15.030
No, I'm not jealous.

00:18.126 --> 00:20.637
All right, I'd kill a
hobo if it'll get me laid.

00:20.705 --> 00:22.106
Now, can we order?

00:22.173 --> 00:25.708
Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.575
So what? It's the same food.

00:27.643 --> 00:29.482
Oh, is it? Look at this.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.719
General Tso's Chicken

00:30.787 --> 00:32.487
is no longer listed under "specialties."

00:32.555 --> 00:34.589
It's now under "chicken."

00:34.656 --> 00:35.893
So?

00:35.960 --> 00:38.596
Yes, General Tso.

00:39.698 --> 00:42.499
Not "Tso," the chicken, "so" the question.

00:43.501 --> 00:44.567
So?

00:44.635 --> 00:47.268
So, why is it no longer a specialty?

00:48.303 --> 00:49.569
Did the chef lose confidence

00:49.636 --> 00:51.770
in the dish or himself?

00:51.838 --> 00:53.338
And look over here.

00:53.406 --> 00:57.175
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

00:57.243 --> 00:59.677
What is "mobster sauce"?

00:59.745 --> 01:01.412
It's obviously a typo.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.683
Perhaps. Or perhaps this restaurant's

01:03.751 --> 01:06.588
now a front for organized crime.

01:06.656 --> 01:08.090
For all we know, the mobster sauce

01:08.158 --> 01:11.294
contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.132
No, no, no, no-- I think it just means

01:13.199 --> 01:15.034
it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.

01:15.102 --> 01:17.270
It doesn't mean any of that!

01:17.338 --> 01:18.538
It's a typo.

01:18.606 --> 01:19.773
You know what? Let's just get a pizza.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.842
Good idea. We'll go to Corleone's.

01:23.077 --> 01:24.911
Sure, no mobsters there.

01:27.283 --> 01:29.418
You know, the more I think about it,

01:29.486 --> 01:31.987
the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain

01:32.055 --> 01:34.057
chunks of mobster.

01:35.492 --> 01:36.593
And why is that?

01:36.661 --> 01:38.328
It was listed under "seafood."

01:40.767 --> 01:43.435
What if they were mobsters
who slept with the fishes?

01:48.141 --> 01:50.743
Leonard, are we having a
serious conversation or not?

01:52.947 --> 01:54.380
What the...?

02:00.521 --> 02:01.621
The TV is gone.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.423
So are our laptops.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.692
Oh, God.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.527
Oh, God.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.596
Oh, God!

02:12.199 --> 02:13.399
It's all right.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.236
They didn't take my comic books.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.839
Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state

02:20.907 --> 02:24.143
Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait!

02:24.211 --> 02:25.812
The Earth began to cool

02:25.880 --> 02:28.515
The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools

02:28.582 --> 02:31.017
We built the Wall
We built the pyramids

02:31.085 --> 02:33.719
Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery

02:33.787 --> 02:35.621
That all started with a big bang

02:35.688 --> 02:37.322

our Super Nintendo,
our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.

When does the CSI team get here?

03:25.718 --> 03:27.652
What?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.721
In anticipation of their arrival,

03:29.789 --> 03:31.656
I've bagged some evidence.

03:31.724 --> 03:33.458
One of the thieves had the audacity

03:33.525 --> 03:35.726
to quench his thirst while
ransacking our home.

03:35.794 --> 03:37.895
You should be able to pull
some good prints off this.

03:37.963 --> 03:39.330
And now, here are my prints

03:39.397 --> 03:41.932
so you can rule me out as a suspect.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.433
What about me?

03:43.501 --> 03:45.568
I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's too early to discount

03:45.636 --> 03:48.104
the possibility of this being an inside job.

03:48.172 --> 03:51.608
Would I be completely out of
line to ask you to shoot him?

03:52.943 --> 03:54.911
I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour

03:54.978 --> 03:56.312
psychiatric hold.

03:57.347 --> 03:58.847
I'm not crazy.

03:58.915 --> 04:01.016
My mother had me tested.

04:01.084 --> 04:02.417
We're done here.

04:02.485 --> 04:04.886
Call this number, and we'll
fax you a copy of the report

04:04.953 --> 04:06.354
so you can submit it to
your insurance company.

04:06.421 --> 04:07.855
I-I'm sorry.

04:07.923 --> 04:09.424
That's the end of your inquiry?

04:09.492 --> 04:13.562
Do you have any more information
that might be relevant?

04:13.629 --> 04:15.630
Oh, my goodness.
Where do I begin? For instance--

04:15.698 --> 04:17.199
my laptop contained

04:17.267 --> 04:19.068
four out of the five gedankenexperiments

04:19.136 --> 04:20.603
necessary for a cogent restatement

04:20.671 --> 04:22.038
of the quantum measurement problem.

04:22.106 --> 04:24.040
How is that going to help them?

04:24.108 --> 04:26.209
Well, they could monitor
scientific publications

04:26.277 --> 04:28.879
and see if anyone posts such a
cogent restatement in the next

04:28.947 --> 04:30.047
couple of months. If so,

04:30.114 --> 04:31.214
the authors are most likely

04:31.282 --> 04:32.916
in possession of my stolen laptop.

04:34.452 --> 04:35.786
Good night, fellas.

04:37.122 --> 04:39.857
Come on, Bochco.

04:49.468 --> 04:52.436
What are we supposed to do now?

04:52.504 --> 04:54.539
<i>The only thing we can do.</i>

04:54.606 --> 04:57.041
Watch TV on our phones
until the criminals return

04:57.109 --> 04:59.411
and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.

04:59.478 --> 05:02.580
Does that mean you've
ruled me out as a suspect?

05:02.648 --> 05:04.382
Oh, how I wish I could.

05:55.735 --> 05:58.337
I do not have to urinate.

06:02.376 --> 06:05.044
I am the master of my own bladder.

06:07.348 --> 06:09.015
Drat.

06:12.252 --> 06:14.020
I can't believe it.

06:14.087 --> 06:15.788
If I hadn't been working the dinner shift,

06:15.856 --> 06:17.657
I would've run right into the robbers.

06:17.724 --> 06:20.026
Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.

06:20.094 --> 06:21.260
I'm not scared.

06:21.328 --> 06:23.496
I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.

06:25.332 --> 06:26.499
Leonard and Penny.

06:26.566 --> 06:27.733
Leonard and Penny.

06:27.801 --> 06:28.901
Leonard and Penny.

06:28.969 --> 06:30.102
Hand me the bat.

06:34.374 --> 06:36.474
We just had a major crime in the building,

06:36.542 --> 06:38.409
and you open the door
without asking who it is?

06:40.179 --> 06:41.712
It won't happen again. What's up?

06:41.780 --> 06:43.880
Nothing.

06:43.948 --> 06:46.082
I just wanted to see if you were both okay.

06:46.150 --> 06:47.317
We're fine, Sheldon.

06:48.953 --> 06:50.720
All right, then.

06:50.788 --> 06:53.056
Good night. Good night.

06:55.092 --> 06:57.426
That was weird, even for him. Mm-hmm.

06:57.494 --> 06:58.928
Leonard and Penny.

06:58.995 --> 07:00.229
Leonard and Penny.

07:00.296 --> 07:01.897
Leonard and Penny.

07:03.566 --> 07:06.435
Who is it?

07:06.503 --> 07:08.237
Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.706
Yes?

07:10.774 --> 07:12.241
May I come in?

07:14.177 --> 07:16.178
Yeah.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.821
I see you're drinking wine.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.723
Yes, we are.

07:28.791 --> 07:30.158
And we're about to go to bed.

07:30.226 --> 07:32.194
Uh-huh.

07:33.363 --> 07:35.330
Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?

07:35.398 --> 07:37.900
Oh, as small as Leonard is,

07:37.968 --> 07:40.536
I don't think the two of you'd
be comfortable on the couch.

07:42.373 --> 07:43.740
<i>What do you want?</i>

07:43.808 --> 07:46.776
It's not what I want,
it's what evolution wants.

07:46.845 --> 07:48.045
Human beings are primates.

07:48.112 --> 07:49.779
Primates have evolved to live in groups,

07:49.847 --> 07:52.182
both for protection and support.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.652
But you don't like other people.

07:55.954 --> 07:58.656
I do tonight.

07:58.724 --> 08:01.259
It's scary over there.

08:01.327 --> 08:03.529
It's getting scary here, too.

08:11.337 --> 08:14.072
Um... three little kittens?

08:16.676 --> 08:17.742
Three little pigs?

08:22.682 --> 08:24.348
God, I don't know.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.950

08:27.519 --> 08:29.820

have made this easier.

08:34.591 --> 08:37.826

08:47.101 --> 08:48.735
Pear-tickle.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.973
Higgs Boson Particle.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.975
How could you not get that?

08:55.042 --> 08:57.477
He's right, Penny. It's all there.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.315
Sheldon, sweetie,
I know you're feeling insecure,

09:02.383 --> 09:04.083
but we've really got to go to sleep.

09:04.151 --> 09:06.920
All right. I'll take the first watch

09:06.988 --> 09:08.388
and wake you at 0400.

09:08.456 --> 09:09.823
Great. Good night.

09:09.891 --> 09:11.458
Wait, wait-- what's 0400?

09:11.526 --> 09:13.727
4:00 a.m. That's, like, in 45 minutes.

09:13.795 --> 09:15.096
Just keep walking.

09:34.584 --> 09:36.018
It's quiet out there.

09:36.086 --> 09:38.187
Maybe a little too quiet.

09:38.255 --> 09:39.521
Where are you going?

09:39.589 --> 09:41.356
Just gonna take a look around outside.

09:41.424 --> 09:43.425
Bad idea.

09:45.762 --> 09:47.529
No, Jim, don't open the door!

09:47.597 --> 09:49.932
Listen to her, Jim.

09:52.768 --> 09:53.868
Don't worry.

09:53.936 --> 09:55.202
There's no one out there.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.479
Leonard and Penny!

10:06.546 --> 10:07.813
Leonard and Penny!

10:07.881 --> 10:09.215
Leonard and Penny!

10:10.718 --> 10:13.119
Who is it?

10:15.414 --> 10:18.015
All right, we've got a titanium dead bolt

10:18.083 --> 10:19.449
and a reinforced jamb

10:19.517 --> 10:22.186
controlled by a state-of-th
e-art electronic access system.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.421
What if they cut the power?

10:23.488 --> 10:25.122
There's a 200-watt uninterruptible

10:25.190 --> 10:26.424
backup power supply.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.193
What if someone steals my keys? There are

10:28.260 --> 10:30.962
independent voice and fingerprint scanners.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.231
What if someone kidnaps me,
forces me to record my voice,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.667
and then cuts off my thumb?

10:35.735 --> 10:38.370
I'll send them a basket of muffins.

10:40.106 --> 10:43.274
Now, inside, we've got motion detectors,

10:43.342 --> 10:47.578
infrared sensors,
and cameras connected to a server

10:47.646 --> 10:50.548
running state-of-th
e-art facial recognition software.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.449
Where did you get all this stuff?

10:52.517 --> 10:55.285
Eh, I got a buddy over at
the Department of Defense.

10:55.353 --> 10:56.653
He just gave it to you?

10:56.721 --> 10:59.222
I'm sure he would have if I had asked.

11:00.024 --> 11:00.957
Ironically, their security

11:01.025 --> 11:03.293

I am the master of my own bladder.

12:51.374 --> 12:53.075
Leonard and Penny.

12:53.143 --> 12:54.143
Leonard and Penny.

12:54.210 --> 12:55.177
Leonard and Penny.

12:55.245 --> 12:56.178
Oh, my...

12:56.246 --> 12:59.816
God, Sheldon.

13:01.819 --> 13:05.221
What the hell are you doing out there?

13:07.791 --> 13:09.792
I heard a noise.

13:10.894 --> 13:12.228
It was us.

13:12.296 --> 13:13.830
We knocked over a lamp.

13:13.898 --> 13:15.798
Why would you knock over a lamp?

13:15.866 --> 13:17.767
We were going to have... He doesn't need

13:17.835 --> 13:20.069
to know what we were doing, Leonard.

13:21.104 --> 13:24.206
Oh.

13:24.274 --> 13:26.675
No, she's right, I don't need
to know what you were doing.

13:26.743 --> 13:28.743
Carry on.

13:28.811 --> 13:29.744
What are you doing?

13:29.812 --> 13:32.380
Use the door.

13:32.448 --> 13:33.815
Good thinking.

13:34.850 --> 13:36.817
Perhaps I'll check the perimeter

13:36.885 --> 13:38.118
and make some warm milk.

13:38.186 --> 13:40.688
Great, you do that.

13:40.755 --> 13:43.891
Would you like me to
bring you some warm milk?

13:43.959 --> 13:45.726
I'm lactose intolerant.

13:45.794 --> 13:48.196
And you don't wish to alarm
me with any more loud noises.

13:48.263 --> 13:49.497
Very thoughtful.

13:50.799 --> 13:52.200
Warm milk, Penny?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.667
No, thanks.

13:53.735 --> 13:55.369
Fine.

13:55.437 --> 13:56.671
Good night to you, sir.

13:57.205 --> 13:58.973
Miss.

14:01.110 --> 14:02.176
Sorry about that.

14:02.244 --> 14:04.044
Ugh, what can you do?

14:04.112 --> 14:05.779
Here.

14:05.847 --> 14:08.648
Intruder alert, intruder alert.

14:08.716 --> 14:10.716
Intruder alert, intruder alert.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.662
Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.298
Sheldon, are you okay?

14:27.365 --> 14:28.733
I-I'm fine...

14:28.800 --> 14:33.270
although I'm no longer the
master of my own bladder.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.442
My new computer came

14:38.510 --> 14:41.746
with Windows 7.

14:41.813 --> 14:45.282
Windows 7 is much more use
r- friendly than Windows Vista.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.419
I don't like that.

14:51.422 --> 14:53.691
Don't you think looking
for a new city to live in

14:53.758 --> 14:56.126
is a bit of an overreaction?

14:56.194 --> 14:57.995
Our apartment was broken into,

14:58.062 --> 14:59.863
our security system tried to kill me,

14:59.931 --> 15:02.832
and as a result,
I'm leaving Pasadena forever.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.402
Tell me how that's overreacting.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.437
Come on, Sheldon, you can't move.

15:07.505 --> 15:09.072
Don't you need to stay in one place

15:09.139 --> 15:10.507
so the mother ship can find you

15:10.574 --> 15:13.409
when it returns?

15:13.477 --> 15:16.245
Oh, if that were only true.

15:16.313 --> 15:19.382
Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future,

15:19.449 --> 15:21.917
I need to find a location
that's more hospitable

15:21.985 --> 15:25.320
than the mean streets of Pasadena, like...

15:25.388 --> 15:27.055
Enid, Oklahoma.

15:27.123 --> 15:28.590
Low crime rate

15:28.658 --> 15:31.793
and high-speed Internet connectivity...

15:31.861 --> 15:34.395
but no model train shops.

15:36.098 --> 15:38.899
Sorry, Enid.

15:40.902 --> 15:43.169
Is he quitting his job at the university?

15:43.237 --> 15:45.405
Oh, no, he's going to telecommute.

15:45.473 --> 15:48.008
Everybody's really excited about it.

15:48.076 --> 15:49.242
All right.

15:49.310 --> 15:52.278
Boone, North Carolina.

15:52.346 --> 15:54.580
"Every summer since 1952,

15:54.648 --> 15:57.683
"Boone has hosted an outdoor
amphitheater portrayal

15:57.750 --> 16:01.920
of the life and times of
its namesake, Dan'l Boone."

16:03.189 --> 16:05.691
Sounds like something that
would attract the wrong crowd.

16:08.862 --> 16:10.596
Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?

16:10.664 --> 16:11.798
Born and raised.

16:17.905 --> 16:20.741
It will take me a few days to get settled.

16:20.809 --> 16:24.044
After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs

16:24.112 --> 16:26.013
containing diagrams and instructions

16:26.081 --> 16:27.815
that will guide you through
packing and shipping

16:27.883 --> 16:30.350
the rest of my possessions
to Bozeman, Montana.

16:31.519 --> 16:33.353
In the meantime, please forward my mail.

16:34.388 --> 16:35.555
Any place specific

16:35.622 --> 16:38.124
or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?

16:39.593 --> 16:41.527
I sense you're making a joke,

16:41.594 --> 16:44.529
but Bozeman does have a comedy
club called The Loony Bin,

16:44.597 --> 16:46.798
so do not forward my mail there.

16:46.866 --> 16:48.565
Oh, come on.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.467
So you were the victim of a crime.

16:50.535 --> 16:52.168
That's part of life.

16:52.236 --> 16:54.404
When my great-grandfather
first came to this country,

16:54.472 --> 16:57.239
he put all his hopes and dreams

16:57.307 --> 16:58.841
into this little butcher shop he ran

16:58.908 --> 17:00.475
on the Lower East Side of New York.

17:00.543 --> 17:01.843
You know what happened?

17:01.911 --> 17:04.779
Every customer who walked
into that butcher shop

17:04.847 --> 17:06.248
and asked for a pound of liver,

17:06.315 --> 17:08.216
got ripped off.

17:09.919 --> 17:11.153
But...

17:11.221 --> 17:14.822
those people moved on, and so should you.

17:14.890 --> 17:16.524
<i>I am moving on.</i>

17:16.592 --> 17:18.659
I'm going to be a Bozite.

17:18.727 --> 17:20.695
They call themselves "Bozites"?

17:20.763 --> 17:22.096
They should. It's one of the first things

17:22.164 --> 17:23.531
I plan to bring up upon arrival.

17:25.501 --> 17:27.669
Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this,

17:27.737 --> 17:29.571
but I'm going to miss you. Please,

17:29.639 --> 17:31.874
Penny, as you know, I'm not comfortable

17:31.941 --> 17:35.244
with prolonged goo
d-byes and maudlin displays of emotion,

17:35.312 --> 17:37.313
so I prepared a short video.

17:40.251 --> 17:41.852
Greetings.

17:41.919 --> 17:45.656
As you know, I'm not comfortable
with prolonged good-byes

17:45.723 --> 17:47.857
and maudlin displays of emotion,

17:47.925 --> 17:49.693
so I prepared this short video.

17:49.761 --> 17:53.330
The four of you are three
of my closest friends

17:53.398 --> 17:55.399
and one treasured acquaintance.

17:59.937 --> 18:02.039
Though I cannot state
categorically that my life

18:02.106 --> 18:04.941
will be diminished by not having you in it,

18:05.009 --> 18:07.177
I am comfortable if you
choose to believe that.

18:09.347 --> 18:10.747
Since you intend to remain

18:10.815 --> 18:13.583
in this lawless metropolitan area,

18:13.651 --> 18:16.253
statistics suggest that
you will succumb to tragic

18:16.320 --> 18:18.722
and gruesome ends before we meet again.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.458
Live long and prosper.

18:23.494 --> 18:24.928
Sheldon, that's so...

18:27.498 --> 18:29.999
You might want to lock the door behind me.

18:31.268 --> 18:32.835
This isn't Bozeman.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.541
How the hell do I know who's the friend

18:38.609 --> 18:40.277
and who's the acquaintance?

18:45.783 --> 18:47.918
That is a bracing cold,

18:47.986 --> 18:49.453
an invigorating cold.

18:49.521 --> 18:51.622
Lord, is it cold!

18:53.558 --> 18:55.760
Help you with your bags, sir?

18:55.828 --> 18:58.496
Thank you, fellow Bozite.

18:58.564 --> 19:01.566
And may I say, you are the
living embodiment of all

19:01.634 --> 19:05.203
the promises made by our lovely
town's Chamber of Commerce.

19:09.175 --> 19:11.176
Wait!

19:12.311 --> 19:14.512
Wait!

19:14.580 --> 19:16.581
Excuse me!

19:26.224 --> 19:28.859
One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.

19:37.345 --> 19:39.212
Hey, look who's back!

19:39.980 --> 19:41.381
Interesting.

19:41.449 --> 19:43.417
The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
