00:34.020 --> 00:36.322
We now return to The Last Man on Earth.

00:36.355 --> 00:39.392
Plus These Other 16 People with
More Showing Up Every Day.

00:39.425 --> 00:41.145
No way they'll pull this off.

00:41.147 --> 00:42.854
A show with just one character

00:42.856 --> 00:44.826
and an unlimited number
of other characters?

00:44.828 --> 00:47.564
Peter, you can't just sit
there and watch TV all day.

00:47.597 --> 00:49.834
- You have to mow the lawn.
- Aw, this sucks.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.575
I was gonna go down
to the Guitar Center

00:51.608 --> 00:52.715
and annoy people.

01:00.376 --> 01:04.429
FYI: My mom's not picking me
up for a long time, because...

01:06.989 --> 01:08.360
she's dead!

01:11.921 --> 01:13.390
Hey, Brian, you want a beer?

01:13.424 --> 01:15.063
Peter, Lois is gonna be home soon.

01:15.095 --> 01:16.509
Shouldn't you be mowing the lawn?

01:16.542 --> 01:18.061
I am mowing the lawn.

01:20.657 --> 01:22.646
- Where'd you get these?
- Craigslist.

01:22.679 --> 01:25.182
Boy, that's got to be some long list.

01:25.216 --> 01:27.886
And pool tables and jukeboxes...

01:27.919 --> 01:29.887
Craig, are you getting all this down?

01:29.920 --> 01:31.389
Yes. Is that it?

01:31.422 --> 01:35.426
No! Futons, everyone's
grandfather's golf clubs...

01:35.460 --> 01:36.560
I-Is that it?

01:36.594 --> 01:38.262
No! Gay sex...

01:38.295 --> 01:40.464
- What kind?
- All of it!

01:44.604 --> 01:46.740
I have milked all the goats.

01:46.742 --> 01:48.745
Peter, all those goats are males.

01:48.747 --> 01:51.350
Well, the buckets are full
and the goats are happy.

01:51.382 --> 01:53.584
I just hope word doesn't get around.

01:54.818 --> 01:56.855
I like good times.

02:00.525 --> 02:02.494
We now return to Top Gun

02:02.526 --> 02:04.495
with only public domain music.

02:13.203 --> 02:16.674
Oh, my God, what the hell
did the goats do in here?

02:16.708 --> 02:18.175
This place is disgusting!

02:18.209 --> 02:19.544
Where's your father?

02:19.577 --> 02:20.713
Peter!

02:28.252 --> 02:30.321
Lois is maaaad.

02:30.354 --> 02:32.490
Go to the Claaaam.

02:32.524 --> 02:35.894
Peter, I both saw you and
recognized my husband's voice.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.763
Go baaaack.

02:39.564 --> 02:41.365
Lois! I-I didn't know you were home.

02:41.399 --> 02:45.003
Well, I guess we can all agree
this was a great idea. The end.

02:47.104 --> 02:49.340
Enough! My parents will
be here any minute.

02:49.374 --> 02:51.342
You better get this house cleaned up.

02:51.376 --> 02:53.512
Don't worry, Lois. I have a Roomba.

02:56.981 --> 02:58.583
Okay, wait, wait, wait a minute.

02:58.615 --> 03:00.584
It'll... it'll figure it out.

03:00.618 --> 03:03.221
It's learning. That's-that's
part of what it does.

03:03.253 --> 03:05.122
I think it's getting it.

03:05.156 --> 03:07.057
Now she's cookin'.

03:07.090 --> 03:09.293
Hang on to your hat.

03:09.327 --> 03:11.797
Clean floor dead ahead.

03:11.829 --> 03:13.697
Good purchase.

03:13.731 --> 03:15.699
Behold the future.

03:15.733 --> 03:17.269
All right, here it goes.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.870
And the battery's dead.

03:22.607 --> 03:24.776
Darling, so wonderful to be here.

03:24.809 --> 03:27.112
Yeah, right. The drive here is like

03:27.144 --> 03:29.780
a counterclockwise trip
around the Monopoly board.

03:29.814 --> 03:32.316
He has no paaaants.

03:32.350 --> 03:34.186
Peter, get out of there.

03:35.953 --> 03:37.788
Lois, what's going on here?

03:37.822 --> 03:40.125
Well, I asked Peter to mow the lawn.

03:40.157 --> 03:42.281
Will somebody turn off Top Gun?!

03:43.345 --> 03:44.896
So obviously he bought a herd of goats,

03:44.929 --> 03:46.965
and now they've taken over the house.

03:46.997 --> 03:49.567
Lois, I worry this is not
a healthy environment

03:49.601 --> 03:51.470
- for the children.
- Mom, please.

03:51.502 --> 03:54.138
You know I would never put
my children in harm's way.

03:54.172 --> 03:55.639
Oh, boy. AMBER Alert.

03:55.673 --> 03:58.509
Stewie was last seen with a
goat in a '98 Toyota Tercel

03:58.543 --> 03:59.911
heading north on I-95.

03:59.943 --> 04:01.847
How do you turn those off, by the way?

04:01.879 --> 04:03.481
Lois, I've seen enough.

04:03.515 --> 04:06.918
You're completely overwhelmed,
and you have four children.

04:06.951 --> 04:09.153
Four children.

04:09.186 --> 04:11.355
Four children.

04:11.388 --> 04:13.455
Four children.

04:13.488 --> 04:15.776
Four children.

04:15.809 --> 04:17.862
Four children.

04:17.895 --> 04:19.263
Hey!

04:19.297 --> 04:20.664
You need help, Lois.

04:20.698 --> 04:22.667
And since I don't believe in psychiatry,

04:22.700 --> 04:24.683
I'm getting you a nanny.

04:24.717 --> 04:26.371
Well, I guess it would be
good to have some help

04:26.403 --> 04:27.463
with Meg and Chris.

04:27.497 --> 04:29.541
And Stewie, if he's ever found.

04:32.176 --> 04:34.446
Honey, do you think
that's the goat and baby

04:34.479 --> 04:36.948
- from the AMBER alert?
- Uh, it's a Tercel,

04:36.980 --> 04:39.584
but I don't think it's the right year.

04:46.758 --> 04:48.493
That must be the new nanny.

04:48.525 --> 04:50.494
Is this the Griffin house?

04:50.527 --> 04:52.898
Welcome to this work environment.

04:52.931 --> 04:55.300
Oh. I'm not the nanny.
I'm her Uber driver.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.868
Your nanny's still in the car.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.669
She dozed off on the way here.

04:58.703 --> 05:00.672
I not doze off, Yoober.

05:00.705 --> 05:03.918
Was looking at crinkled
photos of dead relatives.

05:03.950 --> 05:05.509
Hello. I am Natalia.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.745
What is favorite breakfast fish?

05:07.778 --> 05:09.880
Well, if you must know...

05:09.914 --> 05:13.252
Welcome to this work environment.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.427
Okay, Natalia, level with me.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.795
Why are you really here?

05:22.828 --> 05:25.865
I have been sent to neutralize
liberal Jewish dissident,

05:25.898 --> 05:27.768
Fievel Mousekewitz.

05:29.802 --> 05:31.939
Oh. Well, the only mouse
in this neighborhood is

05:31.972 --> 05:33.974
our innocent neighbor, Frank Maxwell.

05:35.307 --> 05:37.139
Comrade Mousekewitz!

05:37.172 --> 05:39.312
Did you think you could run forever?

05:39.345 --> 05:42.148
I, uh, I think you've
got the wrong mouse.

05:42.182 --> 05:44.617
I'm just regular old Frank Maxwell,

05:44.650 --> 05:46.787
and I'm very late for work.

05:46.819 --> 05:48.321
Good day, ma'am.

05:50.523 --> 05:52.492
Whoa! You killed him?

05:52.525 --> 05:53.893
That was not me.

05:53.927 --> 05:55.796
Someone else got to him first.

05:56.795 --> 05:58.975
Tough break, Jew mouse. Ha-ha!

05:59.695 --> 06:00.967
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

06:01.001 --> 06:03.804
Under parody law, in order to
use someone else's character

06:03.836 --> 06:06.105
in an unlicensed fashion,
we have to provide

06:06.138 --> 06:07.674
something called "commentary."

06:07.706 --> 06:10.743
The commentary here is that
Mickey Mouse hates Jews.

06:10.776 --> 06:14.614
Now, let's see what else this
new nanny has up her sleeve.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.955
Okay, Stewie, this is favorite
Belarusian children book

06:21.987 --> 06:25.291
called Goodnight Moon of Chernobyl.

06:25.324 --> 06:27.360
"Goodnight Chernobyl moon."

06:27.393 --> 06:30.017
Goodnight radiation house.

06:30.049 --> 06:32.165
Goodnight melted phone.

06:32.198 --> 06:34.434
Goodnight glowing milk.

06:34.467 --> 06:37.371
Goodnight bleeding grandpa's eyes.

06:37.403 --> 06:39.839
Goodnight two-headed cat.

06:39.872 --> 06:42.009
Goodnight nobody.

06:42.042 --> 06:45.946
Goodnight blocks and blocks
and blocks of nobody.

06:45.978 --> 06:47.780
"The end."

06:47.814 --> 06:49.383
Next book.

06:49.415 --> 06:51.184
Everybody Poops...

06:51.218 --> 06:52.987
Blood.

06:56.665 --> 06:58.802
I'll get started on dinner.

07:00.969 --> 07:02.438
No need to start dinner.

07:02.471 --> 07:04.773
Homework is done. Kids are fed.

07:04.806 --> 07:07.299
You two should go out and
have lovely evening.

07:07.359 --> 07:10.496
- Together?
- Yes. Everything taken care of.

07:10.528 --> 07:13.126
Go out. Enjoy American freedom.

07:13.159 --> 07:14.439
What do you say, Peter?

07:14.472 --> 07:16.668
Eh, it could be fun. And
we haven't been on a date

07:16.701 --> 07:18.036
since I broke the Guinness record

07:18.069 --> 07:20.780
for longest nasal exhale
at that Tina Fey movie.

07:20.814 --> 07:23.843
You're the baby mama?
Well, that's no bueno.

07:38.891 --> 07:39.992
Hello. I'm Steve.

07:40.025 --> 07:41.527
I'll be your server this evening.

07:41.559 --> 07:43.199
May I start you off with a cocktail?

07:46.398 --> 07:47.799
You don't work here, do you?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.053
I do not.

07:49.734 --> 07:51.369
Oh, this is nice.

07:51.403 --> 07:53.039
So, how's work?

07:53.071 --> 07:54.540
Good.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.710
How, uh...

07:57.742 --> 07:59.978
how's the stuff you
do during your day?

08:00.011 --> 08:01.680
- Good.
- Good.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.549
So... is that it?

08:04.583 --> 08:07.220
Did we do a date? Phones back on?

08:07.253 --> 08:09.522
Peter, we finally have
a chance to reconnect.

08:09.554 --> 08:11.090
We've been given this opportunity.

08:11.122 --> 08:12.691
It's like before we had kids.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.594
We got to make the most of it.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.928
H-Hang on, hang on, Lois.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.331
Give me two of those round balls
of butter and a breadstick.

08:18.364 --> 08:19.764
You'll see where I'm
heading with this.

08:19.797 --> 08:22.902
Okay, look, look, look.
Here's what you want.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.904
Here's what you got.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.072
I'm very happy with what I got.

08:27.105 --> 08:30.967
Hmm. Well, maybe I can give
you half a breadstick later.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.180
As long as you don't mind a
little marinara dipping sauce.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.441
That's absolutely disgusting.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.749
And I love it.

08:37.782 --> 08:40.253
You know what? I like date night.

08:40.286 --> 08:42.422
To Natalia, for making it possible.

08:43.555 --> 08:45.558
Pretty sure that's Steve's pee.

08:45.590 --> 08:47.216
Enjoying your wine?

08:52.831 --> 08:55.103
Oh, what an amazing night.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.103
I told you we could have a fun
time, just the two of us.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.106
Fun's not over yet.

09:01.821 --> 09:03.308
Come on, let's get in the trunk.

09:03.341 --> 09:06.278
I filled it with water so
we can do it hippo-style.

09:06.311 --> 09:07.613
Weightlessly,

09:07.646 --> 09:10.282
with my feet lightly scraping
the bottom as we do it.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.585
Okay. It's kind of sexy, I guess.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.453
And in the hippo tradition,

09:14.485 --> 09:16.788
first we must eat a
whole head of lettuce.

09:16.821 --> 09:20.659
- Now, do you have the lettuce?
- I-I didn't know we were doing this.

09:20.692 --> 09:22.294
Did you bring the lettuce?

09:22.327 --> 09:23.629
Oh, no, I forgot.

09:23.662 --> 09:25.797
Ronald, I asked you to do one thing.

09:25.831 --> 09:28.334
Honey, honey... I brought the lettuce.

09:33.538 --> 09:34.939
So thanks to Natalia,

09:34.973 --> 09:37.143
we've been spending so
much more time together.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.612
Let me tell you, Joe, it's
really been a rediscovery.

09:39.644 --> 09:41.687
- Hmm.
- Joe, "we time"

09:41.721 --> 09:44.557
- is just as important as "me time."
- Okay.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.918
We've actually been watching
The Middle together.

09:46.951 --> 09:49.964
It's so funny! Isn't it funny, Peter?

09:49.997 --> 09:51.990
It is actually funny. At
least three times an episode

09:52.023 --> 09:53.993
we turn to each other and we say,

09:54.026 --> 09:55.695
"That's just like us!"

09:57.196 --> 09:58.531
Why are you laughing?

09:58.563 --> 10:01.032
- It sounded funny.
- But you had to be there.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.369
Well, I was able to
imagine myself there,

10:03.402 --> 10:05.104
which is why I chuckled.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.440
Oh, and, Donna, have you
seen this Black-ish?

10:07.473 --> 10:09.508
- Why are you asking me that?
- I don't know.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.609
It seems like you might like it.

10:11.643 --> 10:14.887
Oh, and, waiter, have you
seen this Fresh Off the Boat?

10:14.920 --> 10:16.816
- Why are you asking me that?
- I don't know.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.517
It seems like you might like it.

10:18.550 --> 10:19.719
Oh, there's Mort. Mort!

10:19.752 --> 10:22.188
Have you seen this The Goldbergs?

10:22.220 --> 10:24.609
Yes! I like it 'cause I'm Jewish.

10:27.759 --> 10:30.781
Boy, our friends all seem
to be happily married.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.666
Yeah, right.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.334
You know, Donna told
me in the bathroom

10:35.366 --> 10:37.035
she and Cleveland haven't had sex

10:37.068 --> 10:38.203
in over three months.

10:38.236 --> 10:39.404
I love that you share things

10:39.437 --> 10:41.139
that were told to you in confidence.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.642
- Oh, and the poor Swansons.
- I know.

10:43.675 --> 10:45.144
Joe's dead from the waist down,

10:45.177 --> 10:46.711
and Bonnie's dead from the waist up.

10:46.744 --> 10:48.080
They're perfect for each other.

10:48.113 --> 10:50.583
I know, I know.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.550
I got to say, Peter,
I really feel like.

10:52.584 --> 10:54.387
Natalia has helped put the spark back

10:54.420 --> 10:55.855
in our relationship.

10:55.888 --> 10:58.263
Yeah, we even had
independent movie sex.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.327
I want to lean over this
half-eaten blueberry pie

11:02.360 --> 11:04.562
and kiss you with black coffee breath.

11:04.595 --> 11:06.250
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

11:09.768 --> 11:12.171
Now, can I do you to a song you know,

11:12.204 --> 11:13.606
but sung in German?

11:27.952 --> 11:31.389
Hello? I see.

11:31.422 --> 11:32.672
What is it?

11:32.705 --> 11:34.486
I've been assassinated.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.905
Wow, what a night.

11:45.937 --> 11:49.207
I guess someone's sleep number is 69.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.610
Uh, yes. It was, apparently,
also number two.

11:52.643 --> 11:55.062
Would you maybe make some
coffee and give me a moment?

11:55.980 --> 11:58.216
Car is packed for weekend.

11:58.249 --> 11:59.552
- Weekend?
- Yes.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.220
You come in late last night drunk

12:01.253 --> 12:03.756
and tell me to pack car
for weekend getaway

12:03.788 --> 12:05.057
you book online.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.060
Then you make me watch
Diff'rent Strokes episode

12:08.092 --> 12:11.732
with substitute teacher played
by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

12:12.464 --> 12:14.333
You know, I forgot about
this weekend trip.

12:14.365 --> 12:16.302
I-Is that something
we still want to do?

12:16.335 --> 12:17.836
Well, I do if you do.

12:17.869 --> 12:20.071
Absolutely I do... I-I was
just seeing if you do.

12:20.105 --> 12:21.673
Of course I do.

12:21.706 --> 12:24.275
I mean, we've already had
six nights out together.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.273
It'd be great to have three more.

12:26.306 --> 12:27.312
That's what I'm saying.

12:27.345 --> 12:28.847
That-That's what any guy wants,

12:28.880 --> 12:31.616
the same gal again and again and again

12:31.649 --> 12:33.985
and again and again
and again and again

12:34.018 --> 12:36.489
and again and again
and again and again

12:36.522 --> 12:38.424
and again and again, and again.

12:38.456 --> 12:40.792
And every gal wants the
same guy who keeps

12:40.826 --> 12:43.461
getting fatter and fatter
and fatter and fatter...

12:43.494 --> 12:45.297
Stop it right there, Lois.
This is Family Guy.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.365
We only do the male side of the joke.

12:48.341 --> 12:51.103
You know what? I think
this weekend will be fun.

12:51.135 --> 12:52.470
Yeah. I mean, it's
not like we're gonna

12:52.504 --> 12:54.005
miss anything around here.

12:58.409 --> 12:59.944
Hey, Joe, what the
hell's going on here?

12:59.978 --> 13:02.147
Oh, you didn't hear?
Today is the opening

13:02.180 --> 13:05.316
of the first-ever Spooner
Street Farmers Market.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.986
Farmers...

13:08.019 --> 13:10.688
market?

13:10.721 --> 13:12.357
Yeah, it's really exciting.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.492
For 50 cents, you can
get your picture taken

13:14.526 --> 13:16.195
wearing a farmer's hat.

13:16.228 --> 13:19.198
Farmer's...

13:19.230 --> 13:21.566
hat?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.536
Hey, have a great weekend, you two.

13:23.568 --> 13:26.905
So glad you're finding
time for each other.

13:30.609 --> 13:31.877
Goat meat.

13:31.909 --> 13:33.545
Get your goat meat here.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.047
- Cleveland, are those...
- Yep.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.882
I have dibs on whatever silliness

13:36.914 --> 13:38.583
Peter loses interest in.

13:38.616 --> 13:39.751
Remember this?

13:39.784 --> 13:41.920
To the Cleveland copter!

13:43.888 --> 13:45.990
The moustache obscures my view!

13:54.881 --> 13:56.283
Oh, another hawk.

13:56.317 --> 13:57.652
Or maybe it's the same one.

13:57.685 --> 13:59.153
You think it could be the same one?

13:59.186 --> 14:00.241
Doubt it.

14:01.054 --> 14:02.322
Hey, do you have the address?

14:02.355 --> 14:04.158
I think it's in my
pocketbook somewhere.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.694
'Cause I got to know if
we should take 24 or 495.

14:06.726 --> 14:08.072
Hang on.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.225
- Anything?
- Hang on.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.602
Exit's coming up.

14:14.735 --> 14:16.163
Half a mile.

14:18.839 --> 14:20.208
Quarter mile.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.509
You'd think I could find it.

14:21.542 --> 14:22.877
Yeah, yeah, I would.

14:22.909 --> 14:25.645
I would. Okay, I'm taking 495.

14:25.678 --> 14:27.781
Okay, uh, here, let me see if it's...

14:27.815 --> 14:30.852
Oh, this is why I don't
like big purses.

14:30.884 --> 14:34.321
Here it is. It says take 24 to 128.

14:54.908 --> 14:56.244
Hey, look, cookies.

14:56.277 --> 14:58.046
- Chocolate chip?
- Oatmeal raisin.

14:59.712 --> 15:03.083
Ah, I guess they stopped
serving dinner at 9:30.

15:03.116 --> 15:05.685
Looks like that missed
exit had the last laugh.

15:05.719 --> 15:06.988
Oh, look at this cute note.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.221
"In lieu of television,

15:08.254 --> 15:10.323
please tune in to each other."

15:10.356 --> 15:13.593
- Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha, indeed. And get this.

15:13.626 --> 15:15.729
"Sorry no Wi-Fi, but the good news is

15:15.763 --> 15:17.532
your marriage has four bars."

15:17.565 --> 15:19.933
- Terrific.
- Oh, here's another note.

15:19.966 --> 15:22.102
"How adorable were
those first two notes?

15:22.135 --> 15:23.837
I hope you read this one third."

15:23.870 --> 15:26.073
There's a used condom
in the fireplace.

15:26.106 --> 15:27.541
And the fireplace is decorative,

15:27.575 --> 15:28.743
so that's here to stay.

15:28.775 --> 15:30.243
So, do you think word just got out

15:30.277 --> 15:31.846
in the daddy longlegs community, like,

15:31.879 --> 15:33.247
"Hey, come to this hotel"?

15:33.279 --> 15:34.714
Peter, it's a little warm in here.

15:34.748 --> 15:37.051
Do you want to turn on
that overhead ceiling fan?

15:37.084 --> 15:38.219
Sure. Looks stable.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.091
- Can you notice that?
- Yeah.

15:43.124 --> 15:45.293
Can you notice anything in
the world other than that?

15:45.326 --> 15:48.562
Only that fist-sized moth in
the lampshade by the bed.

15:48.596 --> 15:51.633
I'm going to bed so that "go
home time" comes faster.

16:02.694 --> 16:04.765
I'll just sleep with the light on.

16:10.116 --> 16:12.620
Natalia, will you be
our nanny forever?

16:12.653 --> 16:14.821
Dah, unless Belarus security force

16:14.855 --> 16:16.957
- track me down.
- I'm sorry, what?

16:16.990 --> 16:18.793
Natalia make a few enemies

16:18.826 --> 16:21.096
before she leave Belarus.

16:28.769 --> 16:31.505
Natalia save baby.

16:35.709 --> 16:37.979
- Brian?
- Lock door.

16:38.012 --> 16:39.013
Why would I...

16:39.046 --> 16:40.348
Brian!

16:43.850 --> 16:45.353
No kissing. Under bed.

16:55.128 --> 16:58.365
Aah!

17:02.670 --> 17:04.172
Out.

17:06.906 --> 17:08.175
Boy, that was a close one.

17:08.209 --> 17:10.211
Ah, my son was in the backseat.

17:58.625 --> 17:59.927
Daddy?

18:09.236 --> 18:10.403
Where are we going?

18:10.436 --> 18:11.838
You're going home.

18:11.872 --> 18:13.742
Count to three and pull cord.

18:15.942 --> 18:19.047
I don't know my numbers!

18:26.333 --> 18:28.040
Again! Again!

18:36.630 --> 18:38.532
- Oh. This.
- What?

18:38.565 --> 18:40.067
That mealy-mouth thing you do.

18:40.099 --> 18:41.201
Take a sip of water.

18:41.234 --> 18:42.869
I don't like water. I like pop.

18:42.903 --> 18:44.471
Hey, will you let me
know when you're done

18:44.505 --> 18:46.107
using the phone charger
that I brought?

18:46.140 --> 18:47.775
Oh, you mean the only
thing that you packed?

18:47.807 --> 18:49.442
Yeah, I just assumed if you pay,

18:49.476 --> 18:51.112
- you don't have to pack.
- Here we go.

18:51.144 --> 18:52.445
My husband, the Rockefeller,

18:52.479 --> 18:54.448
letting my parents pay for the nanny.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.950
Kids still lining up around the block

18:55.982 --> 18:57.250
for those piano lessons?

18:57.284 --> 18:58.786
I wonder which has more clutter on it,

18:58.818 --> 19:00.086
the piano or your treadmill.

19:00.119 --> 19:01.488
You know what? I'm gonna
go with the treadmill.

19:01.521 --> 19:04.090
Really? Let's go knock on
the door of the next room

19:04.124 --> 19:05.925
and ask them which one of us is fat.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.262
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm
not Bradley Hooper.

19:08.295 --> 19:09.563
It's Cooper, not Hooper.

19:09.596 --> 19:11.731
You're thinking of Mr.
Hooper from Sesame Street,

19:11.765 --> 19:13.067
and I'd sooner bang him.

19:13.099 --> 19:15.502
He was a business owner.
He was a successful man.

19:15.536 --> 19:17.404
You think you're the only
one in this relationship

19:17.438 --> 19:19.006
who wants to be with a successful man?

19:19.038 --> 19:20.049
Get over yourself.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.509
Oh, hey, do you want these
spit droplets back,

19:21.541 --> 19:22.809
Or are they for my arm to keep?

19:22.843 --> 19:25.112
Sorry, I was trying to scare
that fly on your hand.

19:25.144 --> 19:26.513
Oh, it's a liver spot. Never mind.

19:26.547 --> 19:29.032
I'm hoping it's cancer.
I want the ticket out.

19:29.065 --> 19:31.018
Oh, if you die, can I
have all of your nothing?

19:31.050 --> 19:32.485
What do you mean if I die?

19:32.519 --> 19:34.855
I've been dead since the
minute I said "I do"!

19:34.887 --> 19:36.323
Well, the minute you say "I don't,"

19:36.356 --> 19:37.590
I am out that door.

19:37.624 --> 19:40.193
- Oh, is that right?
- Yep.

19:40.227 --> 19:42.496
Well, what if I just said,
"The hell with it, go"?

19:42.528 --> 19:43.680
What if you did?

19:45.201 --> 19:46.333
Go.

19:46.708 --> 19:48.061
Fine!

20:42.422 --> 20:44.025
So, how was the trip?

20:47.989 --> 20:52.055

20:52.432 --> 20:53.468
Just terrible.
