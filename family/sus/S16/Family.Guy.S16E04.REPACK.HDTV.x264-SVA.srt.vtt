"And so, for your birthday, Chris,"

00:05.919 --> 00:08.006
I'm giving you this dollar bill.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.056
Don't spend it all in one place.

00:10.057 --> 00:13.093
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

00:13.094 --> 00:14.428
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

00:14.429 --> 00:16.696
ha, ha, ha, arrow.

00:16.697 --> 00:17.931
Ha, ha, ha, ha,

00:17.932 --> 00:20.134
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:20.135 --> 00:22.286
"Love, Grandpa."

00:24.387 --> 00:25.806
What a generous gift.

00:25.807 --> 00:27.040
I know. Isn't money great?

00:27.041 --> 00:28.275
Oh, it's the best.

00:28.276 --> 00:30.362
And now to seal it with a wet cough.

00:31.869 --> 00:34.205
Well, I better get this
dollar bill on its way.

01:15.304 --> 01:17.265
Ah. You there, mailman.

01:17.266 --> 01:18.325
Me?

01:18.326 --> 01:20.693
No, the other black guy
in shorts. Yes, you.

01:20.694 --> 01:21.927
- Here.
- Well.

01:21.928 --> 01:25.632
You, sir, are a racist
and a rude one at that.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.466
So, you're not a mailman?

01:27.467 --> 01:30.169
Okay, yes, I am a mailman,

01:30.170 --> 01:33.472
but these are my 1983
Maurice Cheeks shorts.

01:33.473 --> 01:35.275
So, you're gonna deliver
this card or what?

01:35.276 --> 01:37.210
Mm, fine, I will.

01:37.211 --> 01:38.455
I took an oath.

01:38.456 --> 01:41.614
If mail touches me, I
have to deliver it.

01:43.684 --> 01:46.337
Sorry, it's my chimes.

01:52.993 --> 01:54.681
Hey, Cleveland, come on in.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.832
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!

01:58.833 --> 02:00.367
What the hell's he doing?!

02:00.368 --> 02:02.334
Sorry, Cleveland, he
wanted a surprise party

02:02.335 --> 02:03.969
and this is how he thinks it works.

02:03.970 --> 02:06.624
Surprise! Surprise!

02:07.010 --> 02:08.330
Here you go, Chris.

02:09.191 --> 02:11.710
I also have a fat, weird boy.

02:11.711 --> 02:13.188
Would you like a hug?

02:13.189 --> 02:15.566
Yes. Birthdays are the hardest.

02:17.246 --> 02:19.752
Grandpa only gave me a dollar?

02:19.753 --> 02:21.387
Chris, you write him a thank-you note.

02:21.388 --> 02:23.006
That will is still wide open.

02:24.941 --> 02:27.059
Wow, a dollar.

02:27.060 --> 02:30.596
29 more cents and I can buy
"My Sharona" on iTunes.

02:30.597 --> 02:33.437
Boy, that guy did not
like sharing Sharonas.

02:33.857 --> 02:37.736
♪ Nobody will know 'cause
it's in a coffee cup. ♪

02:37.737 --> 02:39.405
Wow, getting drunk in the morning.

02:39.406 --> 02:41.774
Who are you, Hoda Kot-ba...

02:41.775 --> 02:44.577
Hoda Ka-Ka-ba... H-Kot...

02:44.578 --> 02:45.879
Kathie Lee Gifford?

02:45.880 --> 02:47.474
Ah, come on, it's just an eye-opener.

02:47.475 --> 02:49.373
Just a little hair of the me.

02:49.374 --> 02:52.042
Spoken like a truly unfunny alcoholic.

02:52.043 --> 02:54.578
You know, I bet you couldn't
go a single day without booze.

02:54.579 --> 02:55.880
One day? You're on.

02:55.881 --> 02:57.181
How much you want to bet?

02:57.182 --> 02:59.683
I will bet you one dollar.

02:59.684 --> 03:01.017
Thank you, I will take that

03:01.018 --> 03:03.287
and give you a spoon
'cause you're a dumb baby.

03:03.288 --> 03:06.242
Hey! What the hell do you
think you're... ooh, a spoon!

03:09.745 --> 03:11.729
Okay, another car ride,

03:11.730 --> 03:14.465
another opportunity to
practice my DJ ramp-ups.

03:14.466 --> 03:17.268
Just got to navigate iTunes
while merging onto the freeway.

03:20.639 --> 03:22.239
All right, "Two Princes."

03:22.240 --> 03:23.370
Here we go.

03:24.392 --> 03:28.412
95.5, WPET, you got
Peter "The Riff" Griff,

03:28.413 --> 03:30.948
shockin' ya and rockin' ya while
I'm sittin' here talkin' to ya.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.584
It's 75 and sunny, which
means our Street Squad's

03:33.585 --> 03:35.252
gonna be out looking for
them Super Stickers.

03:35.253 --> 03:36.587
If you don't got one,

03:36.588 --> 03:39.255
get down to Linoleum Depot this
Saturday from 9:00 to 2:00.

03:39.256 --> 03:40.491
I'll be there hooking you up.

03:40.492 --> 03:42.393
Slap one on your car,
win a hundred bucks.

03:42.394 --> 03:44.562
Now, I'm looking around and
I'm seeing the Spin Doctors

03:44.563 --> 03:46.730
with not one, but "Two Princes."

03:48.432 --> 03:49.667
Nailed it.

03:49.668 --> 03:52.336
Okay, time for second breakfast.

03:52.337 --> 03:53.671
Welcome to McBurgertown.

03:53.672 --> 03:55.139
What can I get for you today?

03:55.140 --> 03:58.075
Hmm, what's the easiest
thing to eat in the car?

03:58.076 --> 04:00.010
Um, I'll have the huevos rancheros

04:00.011 --> 04:01.979
and an orange soda without a cap.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.481
That'll be $3.74.

04:03.482 --> 04:06.650
Awesome. I can pay in change.

04:10.672 --> 04:12.690
Mmm.

04:12.691 --> 04:14.325
I should visit the Southwest.

04:14.326 --> 04:16.511
I know I'd love it.

04:23.018 --> 04:24.869
Hey, you guys want to
play a drinking game?

04:24.870 --> 04:26.437
- Fleek yeah!
- Not really.

04:26.438 --> 04:27.671
Well, there's this game where

04:27.672 --> 04:29.607
you try to toss a penny
into a shot glass.

04:29.608 --> 04:30.974
And if you miss, you got to drink?

04:30.975 --> 04:32.443
No, you just drink the whole time.

04:32.444 --> 04:34.144
- Aw, sweet!
- Fleekin' "A"!

04:34.145 --> 04:35.479
No more, Joe!

04:35.480 --> 04:36.947
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

04:36.948 --> 04:39.244
Hey, anybody got a hundred
pennies for a dollar?

04:39.245 --> 04:40.441
I do.

04:41.202 --> 04:43.486
"American Red Cross"?

04:43.487 --> 04:45.322
Yeah. I stole it from a dry cleaner

04:45.323 --> 04:47.742
who refused to put my picture up.

04:52.381 --> 04:53.664
What do we have...

04:53.665 --> 04:54.965
Oop, too young.

04:54.966 --> 04:56.685
Too young, Tommy.

04:59.053 --> 05:00.503
Can I get an iced coffee?

05:00.504 --> 05:02.005
Oh, no worries?

05:02.006 --> 05:04.140
All right, now, I see
you've got large breasts.

05:04.141 --> 05:07.163
In recognition of that, I'd
like to tip you one dollar.

05:09.531 --> 05:11.849
You know, even though you and
Peter have your differences,

05:11.850 --> 05:14.151
I'm glad it hasn't
affected our friendship.

05:14.152 --> 05:16.520
Us redheads have to
stay together, right?

05:18.323 --> 05:20.224
So this is "stuck at work"?

05:20.225 --> 05:22.393
Honey, please. Lois is a friend.

05:22.394 --> 05:24.861
Really, Nicole, you got the wrong idea.

05:24.862 --> 05:26.229
How does this bitch know my name?

05:26.230 --> 05:27.530
Bitch?

05:27.531 --> 05:29.532
Okay, ho.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.835
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

05:31.836 --> 05:33.889
Come on, now, ladies.

05:41.046 --> 05:44.080
Awesome. A chick-chicken chick fight.

05:44.081 --> 05:46.067
Ah, ha, ha.

05:52.074 --> 05:54.925
Since you are my girlfriend and are hot,

05:54.926 --> 05:57.727
will you marry me so
that I can bone you?

05:57.728 --> 06:00.563
As long as you can always
throw a Nerf football

06:00.564 --> 06:03.032
over my truck with your strong arm.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.702
You mean this arm?

06:04.703 --> 06:05.903
Oh!

06:05.904 --> 06:07.537
Ah, cripes.

06:07.538 --> 06:10.459
Yeah, now there is no way.

06:13.228 --> 06:15.412
Hey, a dollar! Neat!

06:15.413 --> 06:19.483
Maybe her knowing I have money
will bring the moisture.

06:19.484 --> 06:21.217
Janine, wait!

06:21.218 --> 06:22.620
I have a dollar!

06:22.621 --> 06:25.307
We could split a Mickey's Big Mouth!

06:34.766 --> 06:36.418
You gon' crash!

06:37.460 --> 06:40.401
Ah, a parchment of value!

06:40.402 --> 06:41.474
What an event!

06:41.475 --> 06:42.640
You said it, friend.

06:42.641 --> 06:45.660
The goddess of money has
fisted our stocking.

07:00.809 --> 07:04.447
Ho ho! Is many funny arms!

07:09.117 --> 07:11.301
So, the guy asks, "What's
the name of the act?"

07:11.302 --> 07:13.637
And they say, "The Aristocrats."

07:13.638 --> 07:16.306
Ah, I didn't tell it right.

07:16.307 --> 07:18.326
Hey, must be my lucky day!

07:21.028 --> 07:22.979
Perhaps I press my luck.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.515
No Whammies, no Whammies, no Whammies,

07:24.516 --> 07:26.483
Big Bucks, Big Bucks, and... stop!

07:32.740 --> 07:34.157
Ah, rats.

07:34.158 --> 07:36.893
Well, perhaps I press my luck with Meg.

07:36.894 --> 07:38.128
Hey there, Meg.

07:38.129 --> 07:39.863
I was wondering if you'd
let me take you out

07:39.864 --> 07:41.999
for a feast of Indian food, followed by

07:42.000 --> 07:44.501
some blow-off-to-the-side curry burps?

07:44.502 --> 07:46.059
Oh, I-I can't tonight.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.035
I, um, I have a date with a Whammy.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.075
All right, well, if you're ever free,

07:51.076 --> 07:52.360
here's me number.

08:00.701 --> 08:02.652
Oh, hi, Chris.

08:02.653 --> 08:05.222
But... well, that's... that's my line.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.091
Hey, I came by to bring you a frame

08:07.092 --> 08:09.193
for that birthday dollar I gave you.

08:09.194 --> 08:10.828
Hi, Meg.

08:10.829 --> 08:12.930
What a disrespectful turd.

08:12.931 --> 08:14.330
You brought a frame?

08:14.331 --> 08:16.033
Why would I frame a dollar?

08:16.034 --> 08:18.235
Chris, didn't you take
a look at that dollar?

08:18.236 --> 08:20.337
It's an extremely rare misprint.

08:20.338 --> 08:23.396
Benjamin Franklin and Washington
are both on the front,

08:23.397 --> 08:25.695
posing back-to-back like an '80s sitcom.

08:29.597 --> 08:32.490
Sorry, Grandpa, I lost that dollar.

08:32.491 --> 08:33.605
You what?!

08:33.606 --> 08:34.969
We got to find that thing!

08:38.038 --> 08:40.057
I get the last joke
before the commercial?

08:40.058 --> 08:42.421
Wow, this is a first.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.361
Okay, okay... a priest, a rabbi

08:44.362 --> 08:46.196
and a Frenchman walk into a bar...

08:46.197 --> 08:48.198
Family Guy will return
after these messages.

08:48.199 --> 08:50.219
- Last line!
- No, it isn't.

08:58.608 --> 09:00.893
All right, Chris, if we're going
to find that misprint dollar,

09:00.894 --> 09:02.628
we have to retrace your steps.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.630
Now, where'd you go after
your birthday party?

09:04.631 --> 09:06.465
Well, first I drank a Four Loko,

09:06.466 --> 09:08.767
and then I rode my bike
down to the hair salon

09:08.768 --> 09:11.637
and shouted "Nope!" at all
the women who came out.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.137
Huh. Call me next time you do that.

09:14.658 --> 09:16.047
Hi, Meg.

09:17.077 --> 09:18.683
Unbelievable.

09:23.467 --> 09:25.356
Can I have a can of chaw and a fork?

09:26.435 --> 09:28.450
Do you need this phone number on here?

09:28.451 --> 09:29.640
Nah.

09:30.931 --> 09:32.742
How long has that bike been out front?

09:32.743 --> 09:34.672
I don't know, a couple hours.

09:34.673 --> 09:36.858
I'm gonna swipe that puppy.

09:38.993 --> 09:41.513
All right, got some vodka and tampons.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.182
Now to go ask Chris how they're
doing this at the high school.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.582
- Aha!
- Stewie?

09:45.583 --> 09:47.351
Wh-What are you doing here?

09:47.352 --> 09:49.520
Busting you. You were gonna drink that.

09:49.521 --> 09:51.121
Technically, no.

09:51.122 --> 09:52.456
Do you even hear yourself?

09:52.457 --> 09:54.124
Look, I'm gonna fix this.

09:54.125 --> 09:57.294
I know a guy who's got pills
that help stop addictions.

09:57.295 --> 09:59.096
Ugh, fine.

09:59.097 --> 10:01.032
All right, we are buying none of these.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.167
Please put them back. But
we'll take one of these.

10:03.168 --> 10:05.637
Ooh, Charleston Chew. Good choice.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.304
You know about putting
them in the freezer?

10:07.305 --> 10:09.006
Yeah. I know about the freezer.

10:09.007 --> 10:10.802
There's nothing you can
teach me, thank you.

10:17.103 --> 10:18.850
All right, this is where
we can buy those pills

10:18.851 --> 10:20.384
to get you off the sauce.

10:20.385 --> 10:21.852
You guys ready for this?

10:21.853 --> 10:23.355
Stewie, who is this guy?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.322
My friend, Todd. He's gonna help us out.

10:25.323 --> 10:26.790
But this looks like a drug den.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.359
What are you talking about?

10:28.360 --> 10:30.327
♪ Drug den, drug den ♪

10:30.328 --> 10:32.162
♪ Drug den, drug den. ♪

10:32.163 --> 10:33.994
I told you it was a drug den.

10:33.995 --> 10:36.427
How you doing? Come on in.

10:43.675 --> 10:45.342
Hello, new friends.

10:45.343 --> 10:47.755
Welcome to my "prescription pad."

10:47.756 --> 10:49.013
Get it?

10:49.014 --> 10:50.581
W-We're dead. We're getting shot.

10:50.582 --> 10:51.629
Oh, calm down.

10:51.630 --> 10:53.717
Heads up. Sometimes my
knob plays peek-a-boo

10:53.718 --> 10:55.386
through my pee hatch.

10:55.387 --> 10:57.087
So, I hear you guys need some benzos.

10:57.088 --> 10:59.143
Yeah, we got to dry this dog up.

10:59.144 --> 11:01.124
W-Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.750
This is my favorite part of the song.

11:07.265 --> 11:08.472
- Tequila!
- ♪ Motoring. ♪

11:08.473 --> 11:10.167
Ah, I'm thinking of a different song.

11:10.168 --> 11:12.169
So, uh, you guys got the $500?

11:12.170 --> 11:13.605
Here's a little taste.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.072
And there's more where that came from.

11:15.073 --> 11:16.874
But I got to see the merchandise first.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.317
Good, good, I need singles.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.210
I got to do laundry so
I can stop hanging out

11:20.211 --> 11:22.046
in my underwear with a bunch of guys.

11:22.047 --> 11:23.847
All right, give me all your money!

11:23.848 --> 11:25.048
Stewie, what's this guy doing?

11:25.049 --> 11:26.880
No idea. I don't know him that well.

11:26.881 --> 11:29.627
He was kicking a Redbox
machine outside of CVS.

11:29.628 --> 11:31.588
Seemed like the kind of guy
who could help us out.

11:56.765 --> 11:57.881
Damn it.

11:57.882 --> 11:59.601
Pistorius!

12:00.569 --> 12:02.787
Boom! Through the bathroom door.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.721
Did you just name-drop "Pistorius"?

12:04.722 --> 12:06.423
He's still a hero to us.

12:06.424 --> 12:09.427
So I made it, Cleveland made
it, and now you made it, Joe.

12:09.428 --> 12:10.628
Yeah. Thanks for the recap.

12:10.629 --> 12:13.230
Yeah. Everybody's made it but this guy.

12:13.231 --> 12:14.731
Quit it! Get off of me.

12:14.732 --> 12:15.933
Ah, what's wrong, Pete?

12:15.934 --> 12:17.302
Boop. Boop. Boop-boop-boop.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.602
Stop it! Stop touching me.

12:18.603 --> 12:20.270
Hey, guys, I did it three more times

12:20.271 --> 12:22.257
while you were grab-assing.

12:27.628 --> 12:29.614
Need a lift?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.288
We could be a Geico commercial.

12:38.289 --> 12:40.357
You're absolutely right.

12:40.358 --> 12:43.594
You don't have ass or grass,
so I'll be taking this dollar.

12:44.963 --> 12:46.399
No, no, no. I don't want ass.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.769
Just give me the dollar.

12:48.770 --> 12:51.338
And now to turn slightly.

12:53.574 --> 12:55.133
Ah, heck!

12:55.134 --> 12:56.576
I did a fail.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.536
Ah, a dollar.

13:08.605 --> 13:10.123
Oh, my dollar.

13:10.124 --> 13:12.092
I guess Meg didn't care.

13:12.093 --> 13:14.095
My heart broken,

13:14.096 --> 13:17.130
and nothing to console me but
the screaming black dolphins.

13:17.131 --> 13:19.667
Man, that dollar's
getting all over town.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.302
Yeah, like your mama.

13:21.303 --> 13:23.537
Ah, dag!

13:23.538 --> 13:25.340
Aw, man, you know I'm just playin'.

13:25.341 --> 13:27.174
Hey, man, you seen that movie The Cove?

13:27.175 --> 13:28.375
The Cove?

13:28.376 --> 13:30.270
How yous gonna be
talkin' about The Cove?

13:30.271 --> 13:33.814
I mean, I saw the movie, but
I was like, "Oh, (BLEEP)."

13:33.815 --> 13:36.017
Ah, man, you know, what even is a cove?

13:36.018 --> 13:38.820
I think it's like what a
white dolphin calls a bay.

13:38.821 --> 13:40.455
They be all like, "Honey",

13:40.456 --> 13:43.191
I'm taking Cooper and
Tucker down to the cove."

13:43.192 --> 13:44.892
- Right, right.
- Rest of us be like,

13:44.893 --> 13:48.128
- ♪ Sittin' in the mornin' sun. ♪
- Don't do it, then,

13:48.129 --> 13:49.463
- don't do it!
- Oh, I'm-a do it!

13:49.464 --> 13:51.464
All right, t-then just
squeak out the whistle part.

14:15.607 --> 14:17.859
You ever had your heart broken, Jerome?

14:17.860 --> 14:19.259
Hell yeah, man.

14:19.260 --> 14:21.028
Married my high school sweetheart.

14:21.029 --> 14:24.364
Week after our wedding, she
was diagnosed with cancer.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.900
At her funeral, our little
girl caught pneumonia.

14:26.901 --> 14:29.870
We buried her next to her
mom six weeks later.

14:29.871 --> 14:32.939
You never seen a casket so small.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.442
I hear you.

14:34.443 --> 14:37.043
I gave me number to a girl
and she threw it away.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.897
You and me, fraternity of pain, eh?

14:42.599 --> 14:44.369
Okay, this is the one.

14:45.903 --> 14:47.038
Son of a...

14:56.524 --> 14:58.932
- Come on, Peter. Let's call it.
- No, Joe!

14:58.933 --> 15:01.369
Nobody's leaving until I
sink a penny in that glass!

15:01.370 --> 15:03.638
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- No...

15:03.639 --> 15:05.239
Say, Peter, you know, maybe you should

15:05.240 --> 15:06.807
try this one with your eyes closed.

15:06.808 --> 15:07.908
Just feel it.

15:07.909 --> 15:09.409
But if I close my eyes,

15:09.410 --> 15:12.475
you'll all disappear and I'm
a-scared of being alone.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.655
Don't worry, Peter.

15:14.949 --> 15:16.416
Guys?

15:16.417 --> 15:17.935
We're right here, Peter. Throw it.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.558
Oh, my God, I made it?

15:24.559 --> 15:25.759
- Sure.
- Right in.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.893
Amazing.

15:26.894 --> 15:29.463
Yes! I've never felt so much power.

15:29.464 --> 15:32.517
I'm gonna go have sweaty
day-sex with my wife.

15:33.785 --> 15:34.936
Excuse me, sir,

15:34.937 --> 15:37.707
would you like to buy some
candy to send Jewish kids

15:37.708 --> 15:40.542
to a Jewish place to do Jewish things?

15:40.543 --> 15:42.109
Will it get you out of my bar?

15:42.110 --> 15:43.929
It sure will.

15:54.305 --> 15:57.624
Look who's still standing, bitch.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.646
Go buy yourself something nice in hell.

16:04.961 --> 16:06.333
Hey there, sailor.

16:06.334 --> 16:07.667
What are you doing here?

16:07.668 --> 16:10.605
Oh, sometimes I come
here to think and fart.

16:10.606 --> 16:12.472
So, you still up for our date?

16:12.473 --> 16:14.374
Our date? But I thought you got rid

16:14.375 --> 16:16.009
of the dollar with my number on it.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.681
No, I put your number
in my phone, silly.

16:18.682 --> 16:20.648
So, what do you say?
Are you free tonight?

16:20.649 --> 16:23.017
Let me consult me charts and maps.

16:23.018 --> 16:26.737
Low tide... 5:23.

16:26.738 --> 16:29.689
Oh, yeah. Moonrise, 7:48.

16:31.559 --> 16:32.921
Aye, looks like I am.

16:45.223 --> 16:47.173
Lois, I tossed a penny in a shot glass,

16:47.174 --> 16:50.155
so get your pants off and put
a towel on the kitchen table!

16:50.156 --> 16:51.975
Peter, I'm in the middle of book club.

16:51.976 --> 16:53.841
Forget book club, we're doin' it.

16:53.842 --> 16:56.223
Anyone who doesn't want to see
my big, white, flailing butt,

16:56.224 --> 16:58.036
get the hell out.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.615
Joe, I found a dollar!

17:03.616 --> 17:04.822
That's great, Bonnie!

17:04.823 --> 17:07.107
Let's go to dinner. We
can talk all about it.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.261
What's there to talk about?

17:08.262 --> 17:11.076
I looked down on the ground
and there was a dollar.

17:11.077 --> 17:13.499
Bonnie, save it for the dinner table!

17:15.623 --> 17:17.912
Crap, I don't have any change.

17:18.456 --> 17:20.840
Hey, Seamus, you got
change for a dollar?

17:20.841 --> 17:24.121
I don't know. Is my boat parked
illegally in the harbor?

17:24.122 --> 17:25.175
I don't know.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.713
Are you gonna make a contribution

17:26.714 --> 17:28.214
to the Policeman's Ball?

17:28.215 --> 17:30.884
I don't know. Are you gonna
help me move next week?

17:30.885 --> 17:33.433
Geez, what are you two,
dating or something?

17:33.738 --> 17:35.096
I don't know.

17:43.581 --> 17:46.380
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome to Whispers.

17:46.381 --> 17:48.635
I'm your hostess, Ida, and as always,

17:48.636 --> 17:51.902
I am joined by my trusty
psychic, Ryan Reynolds.

17:51.903 --> 17:54.107
I knew you'd say that.

17:54.108 --> 17:56.977
Piano? Comedy? What don't you do?

17:56.978 --> 17:58.613
Windows.

17:58.614 --> 18:01.338
Trust me, folks, he doesn't, I've tried.

18:01.339 --> 18:02.935
God, this is going well.

18:04.102 --> 18:07.555
Well, Stewie, you were right. I couldn't
make it a day without drinking.

18:07.556 --> 18:08.755
Well, the important thing is

18:08.756 --> 18:11.092
you barely tried and then got shot.

18:11.093 --> 18:13.948
So I read a fun compatibility
quiz in Cosmo.

18:13.949 --> 18:15.228
I don't know if you want to take it.

18:15.229 --> 18:16.707
- I don't.
- I didn't either!

18:16.708 --> 18:17.742
Compatible!

18:17.743 --> 18:19.399
If you'll excuse me, I have to urinate

18:19.400 --> 18:20.934
every time something good happens.

18:22.762 --> 18:24.904
I thought the show was really great.

18:24.905 --> 18:27.825
Thank you. I couldn't help but
notice you talked throughout it.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.444
Take it off!

18:31.445 --> 18:33.331
I want to see if mine look right.

18:34.632 --> 18:36.449
Well, Chris, we've looked all over town.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.952
Might as well check here.

18:37.953 --> 18:40.754
This is where dollar bills come to die.

18:40.755 --> 18:42.441
Wait, Grandpa, look!

18:45.329 --> 18:46.698
I don't believe it!

18:52.016 --> 18:54.268
Oh, no. Now we'll never find it.

18:54.269 --> 18:56.470
Hold on. I got an idea.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.806
Hey, can I turn off everything
but the black lights?

18:58.807 --> 19:01.325
- Sure, I don't care about anything.
- Cool.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.778
Wow, this place is gross!

19:04.779 --> 19:07.798
Yeah, the NBA All-Star Game
was in town last week.

19:08.567 --> 19:09.983
There it is!

19:09.984 --> 19:12.276
I got it, Grandpa!

19:12.836 --> 19:13.987
Attaboy!

19:13.988 --> 19:15.897
Happy Birthday, Grandson.

19:15.898 --> 19:17.057
Thanks.

19:17.058 --> 19:20.060
Hey, so, how much is this
rare dollar worth, anyway?

19:20.061 --> 19:22.862
Ah, well, some dildo wrote
his phone number on it,

19:22.863 --> 19:25.050
so now it's worth jack!

19:41.682 --> 19:43.049
Ho ho!

19:43.050 --> 19:45.685
Is everyone who was in the show!

19:45.686 --> 19:47.487
H-Hold on, everyone. Everyone?

19:47.488 --> 19:50.223
Ellen DeGeneres wants a
selfie of all of us.

19:50.224 --> 19:51.591
Come on, squeeze in, now.

19:51.592 --> 19:53.059
We're gonna blow up the Internet.

19:53.060 --> 19:56.280
Let's take all that we did today
and make it all about Ellen.

20:01.693 --> 20:03.388
Hey, I'm right here!

20:03.389 --> 20:05.223
That caption's a phony!

20:05.224 --> 20:07.225
