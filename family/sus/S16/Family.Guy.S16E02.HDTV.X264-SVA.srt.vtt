WEBVTT

00:36.828 --> 00:38.115
Wow, you guys.

00:38.116 --> 00:40.155
I've never been to a
restaurant where they cook

00:40.156 --> 00:41.623
right in front of you.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.725
Ugh. You know, later we're
going to have to take

00:43.726 --> 00:45.894
one of those forced
happiness family photos

00:45.895 --> 00:48.596
that come in the
restaurant's tacky frame.

00:48.597 --> 00:51.800
Why are you so fucking
negative all the time?

00:51.801 --> 00:55.503
I... uh... wha... I don't... uh, what?

00:55.504 --> 00:56.938
Come on, you guys, relax.

00:56.939 --> 00:58.239
Let's have a fun night.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.674
We haven't done anything as a family

00:59.675 --> 01:02.177
since we sat courtside at that NBA game.

01:04.447 --> 01:06.149
You okay? You guys, okay?

01:07.267 --> 01:08.616
Great seats.

01:08.617 --> 01:11.536
Yeah, it's a whole different
game when you sit down here.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.660
Huh, "samurai" or "geishas."

01:18.661 --> 01:19.894
Which one am I?

01:19.895 --> 01:21.913
I'll just wait till
somebody else goes in.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.567
Well, that wasn't helpful.

01:25.568 --> 01:27.836
Hmm, this one's holding a fan.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.469
That's usually what I need
when I'm done in a bathroom.

01:30.470 --> 01:32.207
Oop, no urinals.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.524
Must've guessed wrong.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.779
Wow, look at this place.

01:37.780 --> 01:40.348
There's candles, hand lotion.

01:40.349 --> 01:42.283
Whoa, there's not even any swastikas

01:42.284 --> 01:43.785
carved into the toilet seat.

01:43.786 --> 01:45.587
And it's so peaceful.

01:45.588 --> 01:47.222
I haven't heard a guy's booming fart

01:47.223 --> 01:48.823
the whole time I've been in here.

01:48.824 --> 01:51.526
I feel more relaxed than
a chick on Facebook

01:51.527 --> 01:53.678
with her legs in front of a pool.

01:54.579 --> 01:56.379
_

01:56.846 --> 01:58.846
_

01:59.153 --> 02:01.153
_

02:06.426 --> 02:08.109
All right, Lois, I'm off to the mall.

02:08.110 --> 02:09.544
I'll be back in about 20 minutes.

02:09.545 --> 02:10.845
Oh, what are you gonna buy?

02:10.846 --> 02:13.047
Nothing. After the other
night, I made a decision:

02:13.048 --> 02:15.817
from now on, I'm only
using women's restrooms.

02:15.818 --> 02:17.819
What? You can't do that. You're a man.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.987
You'll get in trouble.

02:18.988 --> 02:20.388
Oh, I got that covered.

02:20.389 --> 02:21.756
I'm going to Anthropologie.

02:21.757 --> 02:23.491
I'll just ask them for
something so ridiculous,

02:23.492 --> 02:25.460
they'll have to check
in the back for it.

02:25.461 --> 02:28.163
And then I'll sneak into
their ladies' room.

02:28.164 --> 02:30.598
Yes, I'd like a $4,000 ping-pong table

02:30.599 --> 02:32.066
that's shaped like Easter Islan

02:32.067 --> 02:33.518
We have one right over there.

02:34.347 --> 02:36.347
_

02:36.723 --> 02:38.139
Okay.

02:38.140 --> 02:40.575
How about a telephone that's
made of vintage phone book paper

02:40.576 --> 02:43.678
and doesn't make or receive
phone calls or work in any way?

02:43.679 --> 02:45.698
You mean like this one right here?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.663
_

02:47.664 --> 02:49.817
- Right, but what if I wanted...
- Sir, sir?

02:49.818 --> 02:51.286
There's nothing you can possibly imagine

02:51.287 --> 02:53.454
that's strange or useless
enough that we don't have it

02:53.455 --> 02:54.689
here at Anthropologie.

02:54.690 --> 02:57.859
I know one thing you don't
have, black customers.

02:57.860 --> 03:00.195
Ah! I'm melting!

03:00.196 --> 03:02.346
Ha-ha! To the ladies' room!

03:10.884 --> 03:13.151
Wow, this is the nicest one yet.

03:13.152 --> 03:14.514
_

03:14.515 --> 03:16.908
Eh, what are the odds
she's gonna show up?

03:24.184 --> 03:26.901
Did you get your ass
kicked by Meryl Streep?

03:26.902 --> 03:29.070
No, it was just some
low-class cockney woman

03:29.071 --> 03:31.439
from the mid-1800s and...

03:31.440 --> 03:34.075
Bravo!

03:34.076 --> 03:36.369
She is amazing.

03:36.370 --> 03:37.676
Thank you.

03:39.065 --> 03:40.849
Stay out of my crapper.

03:43.018 --> 03:45.086
And the Oscar goes to...

03:45.087 --> 03:48.523
Meryl Streep, for Stay
Out of My Crapper.

03:58.151 --> 04:00.568
Ah, the ladies' room at Wimbledon.

04:00.569 --> 04:03.304
This must be the fanciest
bathroom in the world.

04:03.305 --> 04:05.173
Uh-oh, looks like these are in use.

04:13.112 --> 04:14.665
Deuce.

04:19.739 --> 04:23.608
Hey, uh, don't tell Mom that we
don't use car seats with me.

04:26.146 --> 04:27.929
Unhand me! What do you
think you're doing?!

04:27.930 --> 04:30.932
Okay, Stewie, you're gonna
help Daddy by holding his iPad

04:30.933 --> 04:34.435
while he watches season
one of House of Cards.

04:39.025 --> 04:40.948
Wh... where was the house?

04:40.949 --> 04:42.477
Where was the house of cards?

04:42.478 --> 04:44.612
All right, Stewie, time to go.

04:44.613 --> 04:47.593
Whoa, whoa. A little wobbly.

04:47.594 --> 04:49.017
Guess my legs fell asleep.

04:50.186 --> 04:51.753
Aah!

04:51.754 --> 04:54.756
Stewie, Daddy can't feel
his legs. Go get help!

04:54.757 --> 04:57.192
I'm hanging from a door, you idiot!

05:00.229 --> 05:03.198
By the way, you're down
to five percent battery.

05:03.199 --> 05:05.833
Oh, damn it, my head.

05:05.834 --> 05:08.203
Well, no wonder... you're
running all the apps at once.

05:09.605 --> 05:12.523
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

05:14.594 --> 05:16.010
There he is.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.579
Welcome back, buddy.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.681
- Who are you?
- I'm a paramedic.

05:19.682 --> 05:21.149
Name's Stryker Foxx.

05:22.284 --> 05:23.751
Oh, Lois just texted.

05:23.752 --> 05:25.968
"Burgers or meatballs for dinner?"

05:25.969 --> 05:27.487
I'll text back for you.

05:27.488 --> 05:31.426
"Same thing, bitch.
Just different shapes."

05:32.895 --> 05:34.762
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

05:34.763 --> 05:36.331
Oh, battery died.

05:36.332 --> 05:38.266
Sir, you've sustained a head injury.

05:38.267 --> 05:41.269
How many chicken fingers am I
holding up, and do you want one?

05:41.270 --> 05:43.705
Three, and hell yeah!

05:43.706 --> 05:46.107
Mmm. Aw. These are amazing!

05:46.108 --> 05:47.775
Did I die and go to heaven?

05:47.776 --> 05:49.666
Well, you didn't die,
'cause I saved you.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.813
And you're not in heaven 'cause
you're not holding a margarita.

05:51.814 --> 05:53.887
Oh, wait a minute, yes, you are.

05:53.888 --> 05:55.955
You brought a lot of
food in the bathroom.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.475
I always do.

05:58.671 --> 06:00.154
Oh, my God.

06:00.155 --> 06:02.123
Are you the coolest guy ever?

06:02.124 --> 06:04.158
Ah, that's just a silly
title they gave me

06:04.159 --> 06:06.027
down at the Karate
Paintball Dirt Bike Club.

06:06.028 --> 06:07.128
Awesome!

06:07.129 --> 06:08.696
Okay, well, bandaged you up.

06:08.697 --> 06:10.431
You should be good to go.

06:10.432 --> 06:12.567
But just be more careful next time.

06:12.568 --> 06:14.102
I know. What a stupid injury, huh?

06:14.103 --> 06:15.436
I haven't been this embarrassed

06:15.437 --> 06:17.572
since I was a rookie firefighter.

06:22.629 --> 06:25.163
Sorry, first day. Still learning.

06:29.669 --> 06:31.152
Hey, Stryker, wait!

06:31.153 --> 06:33.121
Hey, listen, I just wanted
to say thanks again

06:33.122 --> 06:34.318
for patching me up.

06:34.319 --> 06:35.356
No problem, buddy.

06:35.357 --> 06:37.925
Hey, that's an interesting
necklace you got there.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.794
Oh, this? It's from when I was a kid.

06:39.795 --> 06:41.596
It's half of a "best friend" coin.

06:41.597 --> 06:43.097
I always had this crazy dream

06:43.098 --> 06:45.816
that one day I'd run into the
guy with the other half.

06:50.156 --> 06:52.700
Oh, my God. Cody?

06:52.701 --> 06:56.040
Oh, that must be the name of the
dead surfer I found this on.

07:00.609 --> 07:02.426
We now
return to the Olympics.

07:02.427 --> 07:03.794
Ugh, it's so annoying.

07:03.795 --> 07:05.229
They always use football announcers

07:05.230 --> 07:07.331
for events they know nothing about.

07:07.332 --> 07:09.433
The players are ready
to take the swimming field.

07:10.435 --> 07:11.835
And they're swimming!

07:11.836 --> 07:13.537
They appear to be doing
the forward stroke.

07:13.538 --> 07:14.872
My neighbor has a pool.

07:14.873 --> 07:17.374
I'll take a dip if I know
they're on vacation.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.810
It's neck-and-neck, and
it looks like Canada won!

07:19.811 --> 07:21.995
Uh, no, they're going
back the other way.

07:23.032 --> 07:24.782
What do you think? How do I look?

07:24.783 --> 07:26.383
Like a gas station energy drink.

07:26.384 --> 07:28.619
But you put that on to go to the Clam?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.888
Aren't the guys gonna think
you're a little overdressed?

07:30.889 --> 07:32.511
Oh, I'm not hanging out with the guys.

07:32.512 --> 07:33.831
I met someone new.

07:33.832 --> 07:36.260
His name's Stryker and he's really cool.

07:36.261 --> 07:38.629
Like, he's one of those
guys whose forearm hair

07:38.630 --> 07:40.664
makes his watch look even cooler.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.333
It's Stryker!

07:43.334 --> 07:46.070
I want him to think I was
listening to a cool song.

07:47.539 --> 07:48.672
Yeah, who dis?

07:48.673 --> 07:49.807
Oh, hey, man.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.675
Oh, nothing much. Just getting slurped.

07:51.676 --> 07:53.577
- Ew.
- Oh, you're almost here?

07:53.578 --> 07:55.379
Okay, just, uh, just give me a second

07:55.380 --> 07:57.681
so I can put away all my guitars.

07:57.682 --> 07:59.349
Okay, Seacrest out. Bye.

08:00.351 --> 08:01.718
What the hell was that?

08:01.719 --> 08:03.053
Lay off. Nothing.

08:05.466 --> 08:06.583
Hey, Peter.

08:06.584 --> 08:08.071
Hey, man.

08:08.072 --> 08:09.758
Hola, cha-cha, hi-hi.

08:09.759 --> 08:11.662
- Peter!
- I don't know. It's-it's this house.

08:11.663 --> 08:13.797
I-I got to get out of this house.

08:13.798 --> 08:15.899
Boy, Dad sure seems excited.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.601
I know. I haven't seen him this giddy

08:17.602 --> 08:20.771
since he discovered that
single-loop roller coaster.

08:21.773 --> 08:23.807
Ah...

08:24.809 --> 08:26.877
Ah...

08:27.879 --> 08:29.213
Ah...

08:29.214 --> 08:30.414
Uh, don't feel so good.

08:30.415 --> 08:31.915
Ew!

08:31.916 --> 08:33.717
Ah...

08:33.718 --> 08:34.985
Ew!

08:34.986 --> 08:36.687
Ah...

08:36.688 --> 08:38.572
Ew!

08:45.597 --> 08:47.498
Wow, what a cool loft.

08:47.499 --> 08:50.701
I bet it cost a ton to make
this place look unfinished.

08:50.702 --> 08:52.336
Hey, come over here.
There's someone I want

08:52.337 --> 08:55.873
to introduce you to,
1997 George Clooney.

08:55.874 --> 08:58.842
Wow! That's the coolest
George Clooney there is!

08:58.843 --> 09:01.578
Hi, George Clooney, second worst Batman.

09:01.579 --> 09:03.113
Peter Griffin, second best Homer.

09:03.114 --> 09:04.882
You may have heard, I'm also known

09:04.883 --> 09:06.884
for my practical jokes on the set.

09:06.885 --> 09:09.887
One time, I nailed Nora Dunn
in the head with an apple.

09:09.888 --> 09:12.422
That-that's hilarious
'cause you're handsome.

09:12.423 --> 09:15.192
Otherwise, you're just
some dick who hit a lady.

09:15.193 --> 09:16.960
Aw, thanks for bringing
me here, Stryker.

09:16.961 --> 09:18.328
I'm having the best time ever.

09:18.329 --> 09:20.747
Even better than when
I lived in Santa Fe.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.902
Have you ever seen a prettier sunset?

09:24.903 --> 09:25.903
Never.

09:25.904 --> 09:27.804
It's just so peaceful here.

09:27.805 --> 09:29.106
It sure is.

09:29.107 --> 09:31.041
Mm. Sure is.

09:31.042 --> 09:34.683
Did you also have a very public
meltdown in another city?

09:34.684 --> 09:37.863
- I did.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:47.509 --> 09:48.892
Ugh, it's the guys.

09:48.893 --> 09:50.327
What do those losers want?

09:50.328 --> 09:52.396
Losers? Those are your friends.

09:52.397 --> 09:53.530
Nah, they're lame.

09:53.531 --> 09:56.266
Not one of them has ever
vaped at a funeral.

09:56.267 --> 09:58.368
Hey, Peter. Hey, what
are you doing tonight?

09:58.369 --> 09:59.603
We're gonna watch Cleveland

09:59.604 --> 10:02.105
put a garbage can full
of coins in a Coinstar.

10:02.106 --> 10:04.541
Sometimes it takes my buttons.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.610
Eh, thanks, guys, but I-I can't make it.

10:06.611 --> 10:08.912
I'm, um, I'm getting re-circumcised.

10:08.913 --> 10:10.497
Got a wedding next week.

10:10.498 --> 10:12.049
I just want to clean it up a bit.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.784
Oh, well, that's too bad.
Yeah, maybe next time.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.358
That sounds horrible.

10:15.954 --> 10:18.055
Peter, why did you just lie to the guys?

10:18.056 --> 10:19.878
'Cause I got plans with Stryker.

10:19.879 --> 10:21.325
I don't want them to embarrass me.

10:21.326 --> 10:22.893
Eh, I get where he's coming from.

10:22.894 --> 10:25.062
That's why I never introduce
you to my friends.

10:25.063 --> 10:26.163
What friends?

10:26.164 --> 10:28.632
Like the guys in my photography club.

10:28.633 --> 10:31.001
"Dear Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones

10:31.002 --> 10:32.703
and Jared from Subway,

10:32.704 --> 10:35.305
I feel like I'm the
only one sending pics.

10:35.306 --> 10:37.307
I love all the positive feedback,

10:37.308 --> 10:39.243
but maybe you guys send a pic?

10:39.244 --> 10:41.161
Anyway, here's more pics."

10:48.770 --> 10:50.854
Hey, you ever try that? Wingsuiting?

10:50.855 --> 10:52.289
I mean, basically, yeah.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.057
One time, I jumped off a top bunk

10:54.058 --> 10:56.126
with a towel around my neck like a cape.

10:56.127 --> 10:57.761
It was inside the IKEA.

10:57.762 --> 10:59.529
I landed on a cardboard computer.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.531
We should totally do that sometime.

11:01.532 --> 11:02.933
Nah, I can't go back there.

11:02.934 --> 11:04.517
They got my picture by the door.

11:06.388 --> 11:07.871
Hey, he is in here.

11:07.872 --> 11:10.040
What the hell are you guys doing here?

11:10.041 --> 11:11.708
We were coming back from the Coinstar

11:11.709 --> 11:13.343
and saw your car out front.

11:13.344 --> 11:16.146
Rough night. Turns out
the can was all buttons.

11:16.147 --> 11:18.109
We're not gonna make our mortgage.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.342
What are you doing here?

11:19.343 --> 11:20.984
I thought you were too
busy to go out tonight.

11:20.985 --> 11:22.386
Peter, who are your friends?

11:22.387 --> 11:27.291
Oh, um... Stryker, this is
Quagmire, Joe and Cleveland.

11:27.292 --> 11:28.692
How do you two know each other?

11:28.693 --> 11:30.494
Did you meet at the Harry Potter store?

11:30.495 --> 11:31.928
Peter loves that place.

11:31.929 --> 11:34.698
It was one wand and I was
using a gift certificate.

11:34.699 --> 11:37.267
No, we actually met when I was
administering first aid to him.

11:37.268 --> 11:39.269
- I'm a paramedic.
- For real?

11:39.270 --> 11:41.905
Hey, can I show you seven
or eight things on my body

11:41.906 --> 11:44.107
and ask for medical diagnosises?

11:44.108 --> 11:46.209
This thing here that looks
like a second elbow,

11:46.210 --> 11:47.678
I don't know what it is.

11:47.679 --> 11:49.212
Feels like it's filled with liquid.

11:49.213 --> 11:51.114
Well, I could take a look at it.

11:51.115 --> 11:53.083
No, no, no, guys, guys,
it's his night off.

11:53.084 --> 11:54.217
I have two pee holes.

11:54.218 --> 11:56.219
Stop it! Stop it. Guys,
can I talk to you?

11:56.220 --> 11:58.597
Look, this, this right here

11:58.598 --> 12:00.223
is exactly why I've been avoiding you.

12:00.224 --> 12:02.359
I knew you'd embarrass
me in front of Stryker.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.960
Who cares? He's just some dude.

12:03.961 --> 12:05.919
He's not "just some dude."

12:05.920 --> 12:07.608
He happens to be the
first really cool friend

12:07.609 --> 12:08.810
I've ever had.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.641
What are you talking about? We're cool.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.244
You are absolutely not cool.

12:12.245 --> 12:13.613
Oh, yeah?

12:13.614 --> 12:15.882
Well, then why did those
teenagers on the way in say,

12:15.883 --> 12:17.383
"Cool wheelchair, dick"?

12:17.384 --> 12:19.185
Hey, look, Peter, if you're
so embarrassed by us

12:19.186 --> 12:20.553
and you think we're losers,

12:20.554 --> 12:22.355
well, then we don't want to
hang out with you, either.

12:22.356 --> 12:24.591
Good. Who needs you bums? I got Stryker.

12:24.592 --> 12:25.758
Oh, yeah?

12:25.759 --> 12:28.928
Well, I hope you two are
happy together, you jerk.

12:28.929 --> 12:30.964
Cool wheelchair, dick.

12:30.965 --> 12:33.236
Thanks. Did you see the
backpack hanging off it?

12:46.264 --> 12:47.480
Wow, you know,

12:47.481 --> 12:49.215
I never thought I could be
talked into wingsuiting.

12:49.216 --> 12:50.368
You're gonna love it.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.452
It's just a short hike
from here to the summit.

12:52.453 --> 12:54.554
A hike? It's no problem.

12:54.555 --> 12:57.056
Shouldn't affect my old football injury.

12:57.057 --> 12:58.791
I spilled hot chili on my nuts.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.493
You're a riot, Peter.

13:00.494 --> 13:02.729
Hey, you sure you're up for this?

13:02.730 --> 13:05.899
Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to
something, I go all the way,

13:05.900 --> 13:08.401
like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.

13:08.402 --> 13:10.703
Good morning, guys.

13:10.704 --> 13:12.438
Peter, what's wrong with your voice?

13:12.439 --> 13:14.841
I got punched in the throat
at the Clam last night.

13:14.842 --> 13:17.577
Now I sound exactly
like Kathleen Turner.

13:17.578 --> 13:19.712
I'm just gonna get my stromboli.

13:19.713 --> 13:22.515
Hey! Get away from my
stromboli, Kathleen Turner!

13:23.801 --> 13:26.902
_

13:26.903 --> 13:30.003
_

13:34.846 --> 13:38.197
Wow, that's, uh... that's some view.

13:38.198 --> 13:39.299
I know, isn't it?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.100
You see that rock formation over there?

13:41.101 --> 13:43.503
We're gonna fly right
through the center of it.

13:43.504 --> 13:45.138
It's called threading the needle.

13:45.139 --> 13:46.639
Totally intense.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.108
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
Or-or how about this?

13:49.109 --> 13:51.044
Maybe you jump off this cliff

13:51.045 --> 13:54.047
and I spin around over there
and sing Sound of Music.

13:54.048 --> 13:56.482
Or-or we could just go home
and watch Sound of Music.

13:56.483 --> 13:58.184
I can see you're a
little nervous, Peter,

13:58.185 --> 14:00.320
but I'm telling you, it
is easier than you think.

14:00.321 --> 14:02.071
Watch.

14:15.353 --> 14:17.570
Wow, look at him go.

14:17.571 --> 14:18.905
You know, just when I thought

14:18.906 --> 14:21.841
he couldn't get any cooler,
he goes... Holy fuck!

14:21.842 --> 14:23.776
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

14:23.777 --> 14:26.779
Oh! What-what just... There's
almost nothing left of him!

14:26.780 --> 14:29.015
And I just know I'm gonna be the one

14:29.016 --> 14:30.733
to have to intify the body.

14:32.770 --> 14:36.022
That's him. Poor guy.

14:36.023 --> 14:38.024
He looks like a bowl of tomato soup.

14:38.025 --> 14:39.926
Guy next to him died in a fire

14:39.927 --> 14:42.862
He looks like a grilled cheese sandwich.

14:42.863 --> 14:46.432
Oh, these two poor souls
are the best combination

14:46.433 --> 14:47.717
for a rainy Saturday.

14:53.737 --> 14:55.771
So, hey, guys.

14:55.772 --> 14:57.871
What are we drinking? Beer?

14:57.872 --> 15:01.007
Hey, Quagmire, how about one
of your famous sexual stories?

15:01.008 --> 15:02.242
Take a hike, Peter.

15:02.243 --> 15:04.411
Ah, oh, you-you mean
something Joe can't do?

15:05.480 --> 15:07.581
Friendly jokes indicating closeness.

15:07.582 --> 15:09.282
We heard about Stryker dying.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.384
Ah, craps.

15:10.385 --> 15:11.585
Yeah, give it up.

15:11.586 --> 15:13.286
We know the only reason you're here

15:13.287 --> 15:15.389
is 'cause your cool friend is gone.

15:15.390 --> 15:17.624
That's right. We're not
your floppy seconds, Peter.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.692
It's actually "sloppy."

15:18.693 --> 15:19.993
Well, for me, it's both.

15:19.994 --> 15:21.561
But listen, you really
hurt our feelings.

15:21.562 --> 15:23.730
You can't just treat us like
garbage and then expect us

15:23.731 --> 15:25.532
to take you back like nothing happened.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.368
Okay, that's-that's too bad
'cause that was kind of my plan.

15:28.369 --> 15:29.736
Well, you can go to hell, Peter.

15:29.737 --> 15:31.638
We're tired of you
taking us for granted.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.140
Yeah, and this isn't even the first time

15:33.141 --> 15:34.708
you ditched us for someone else.

15:34.709 --> 15:35.942
Remember when you blew us off

15:35.943 --> 15:37.927
to hang out with Jerry Seinfeld?

15:40.031 --> 15:42.816
Julia Louis-Dreyfus has
a lot of Emmys now.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.834
Yeah.

15:47.645 --> 15:50.229
Why did your wife steal that cookbook?

15:55.480 --> 15:58.098
Peter, I'm sorry about
your friend Stryker.

15:58.099 --> 16:00.600
I know it's got to be hard
to watch a man explode

16:00.601 --> 16:02.235
like a bug on a windshield.

16:02.236 --> 16:03.537
No, it's not that...

16:03.538 --> 16:06.006
I mean, I do see that every
time I close my eyes...

16:06.007 --> 16:07.574
But it's the guys.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.443
They're really mad at
me, and I'm-I'm afraid

16:09.444 --> 16:11.478
they don't want to be
friends with me anymore.

16:11.479 --> 16:13.079
Well, it's hard to blame them.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.649
You treated them like you
don't even care about them.

16:15.650 --> 16:17.584
I do care about them.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.454
It's just, when I hung
around with Stryker,

16:20.455 --> 16:23.523
people thought I was cool,
and it-it felt good.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.692
No one ever thinks I'm cool.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.196
Your friends thought you were
cool, until you dumped them.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.065
Oh, wow, I guess you're right.

16:32.066 --> 16:34.534
I treated them like crap.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.170
I just got to find a way
to make it up to them.

16:37.171 --> 16:38.371
You got any ideas?

16:38.372 --> 16:41.341
Mom? Dad? Can Gary
Glitter, Jeffrey Jones

16:41.342 --> 16:43.526
and Jared from Subway spend the night?

16:45.363 --> 16:46.546
I don't know, Peter,

16:46.547 --> 16:48.348
but it's got to be something
really meaningful,

16:48.349 --> 16:50.016
because imagine how they feel.

16:50.017 --> 16:53.286
After all, you were willing to
jump off a cliff for Stryker.

16:53.287 --> 16:55.689
Well, they didn't say yes,
but they didn't say no.

16:55.690 --> 16:57.257
You're right.

16:57.258 --> 16:58.558
Thanks, Lois.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.145
And now I know exactly
what I have to do.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.499
Uh, where the hell are you going?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.434
Lois told me to go jump off a cliff

17:07.435 --> 17:09.069
to prove my friendship to the guys.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.738
Are-are you, are you sure
that's what she said?

17:11.739 --> 17:13.740
I-I don't know, Brian. Her
shirt was kind of open.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.408
I was trying to get a peek down there.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.527
Anyway, I got to go jump off a cliff.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.804
Peter, wait. H-Hold on. This is crazy!

17:24.519 --> 17:25.519
Damn it.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.020
Where's Peter going?

17:27.021 --> 17:28.244
Huh?

17:28.856 --> 17:31.040
Oh, for God's sake.

17:37.916 --> 17:40.467
Hey, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe.

17:40.468 --> 17:43.904
It's your buddy, Peter, and I'm
about to thread the needle

17:43.905 --> 17:46.172
to prove to you guys how sorry I am

17:46.173 --> 17:48.542
and that I'd do anything
to win you back.

17:48.543 --> 17:50.810
And if something goes wrong
and I don't survive,

17:50.811 --> 17:52.178
you can go ahead and delete

17:52.179 --> 17:54.281
the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.782
I'm-I'm never gonna watch that.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.151
Okay, here goes nothing.

17:58.152 --> 18:01.538
I just wish the sponsor on
msuit was a little cooler.

18:09.481 --> 18:10.830
Peter, stop!

18:10.831 --> 18:12.065
Don't jump!

18:12.066 --> 18:13.300
Brian told us you were gonna...

18:13.301 --> 18:14.801
Why are you wearing a douche suit?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.136
They also make wipes!

18:16.137 --> 18:17.637
They're not known for their wipes.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.406
Peter, you don't have
to jump off a cliff

18:19.407 --> 18:20.640
to prove you're sorry.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.809
Not all of us believe
that, but we took a vote

18:22.810 --> 18:24.744
and I agreed I'd respect the majority.

18:24.745 --> 18:26.346
Look, you really treated us badly,

18:26.347 --> 18:27.847
but the fact that you'd be willing

18:27.848 --> 18:31.184
to literally risk your life just
to show us how much you care,

18:31.185 --> 18:33.420
well, that says a lot.

18:33.421 --> 18:36.089
Listen, I'm so sorry.

18:36.090 --> 18:39.426
If being cool means don't get
to hang out with you guys,

18:39.427 --> 18:41.761
then I don't ever want to be cool.

18:41.762 --> 18:45.098
What do you say? Can we just
go back to being friends?

18:45.099 --> 18:46.933
- Of course.
- You bet.

18:46.934 --> 18:48.168
Totes McGoats.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.236
"Totes McGoats"?

18:50.237 --> 18:52.439
Maybe you guys are cool. Fist bump.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.172
Ah, crap!

18:54.173 --> 18:55.509
- Oh, my God!
- Peter!

18:55.510 --> 18:57.310
Should I shoot him, make it go quicker?

18:57.311 --> 18:58.578
I got a shot.

18:58.579 --> 19:00.680
Too late. You didn't
answer quick enough.

19:10.642 --> 19:12.425
Hey, I'm doing it.

19:12.426 --> 19:14.294
This ain't so hard.

19:14.295 --> 19:16.296
Guys, I'm gonna do it!

19:16.297 --> 19:18.031
I'm gonna thread the needle!

19:18.032 --> 19:20.033
What? We can't hear you!

19:20.034 --> 19:21.851
We're very far away!

19:26.558 --> 19:28.441
Oh, my God, I did it!

19:28.442 --> 19:30.010
I was actually able to thread the...

19:30.011 --> 19:31.645
Oh, crap, Canadian goose.

19:31.646 --> 19:32.679
Look out, eh?

19:35.549 --> 19:37.951
Oh! Damn it! Ah! Son of a bitch!

19:45.159 --> 19:46.893
I think I'm okay.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.693
Ah, nickels!

19:52.684 --> 19:54.701
Well, it's good to be back, you guys.

19:54.702 --> 19:57.404
A-And I'm sorry again I
dumped you for Stryker.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.673
Who the hell is this Stryker
guy you keep talking about?

19:59.674 --> 20:00.907
What do you mean?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.842
He's that cool, handsome
guy I was friends with.

20:02.843 --> 20:05.578
He's the whole reason I went
wingsuiting and hurt my head.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.913
Wingsuiting?

20:06.914 --> 20:09.382
Peter, you hurt your head
in a ladies' bathroom.

20:09.383 --> 20:11.885
Yeah, your legs fell asleep and
you bashed it against a sink.

20:11.886 --> 20:13.753
You were in a coma for two weeks.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.556
You must've dreamed about
this Stryker or something.

20:16.557 --> 20:17.857
No, we were buddies.

20:17.858 --> 20:19.526
We rode on his motorcycle.

20:19.527 --> 20:22.495
And he introduced me to
1997 George Clooney.

20:22.496 --> 20:24.998
Okay, well, right there you
should've known it wasn't real.

20:24.999 --> 20:26.332
Huh.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.134
Well, whether it was real or not,

20:28.135 --> 20:32.005
I want you to know you are the
best friends I've ever had.

20:32.006 --> 20:33.573
Of course we know that, Peter.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.341
Yeah, and we feel the same way.

20:35.342 --> 20:37.477
Hey, this is a really weird question,

20:37.478 --> 20:39.847
but do you boys want to go out dancing?

20:40.514 --> 20:41.642
That night,

20:41.643 --> 20:43.883
we danced until the sun came up.

20:43.884 --> 20:45.752
We forgot all about my coma

20:45.753 --> 20:47.887
and my crazy dream about a cool guy.

20:47.888 --> 20:50.123
We were just four middle-aged men

20:50.124 --> 20:52.692
doing Ecstasy at a Mexican prom.

20:52.693 --> 20:54.944
I'm Peter Griffin, and
these are my stories.
