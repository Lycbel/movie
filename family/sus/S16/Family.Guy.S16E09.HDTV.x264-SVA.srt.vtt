<i>Christmas in Wonderland.</i>

06:05.758 --> 06:07.025
Well, before you sit down,

06:07.026 --> 06:08.860
I just need you to do a couple things.

06:08.861 --> 06:10.528
Okay, first, I need you to take down

06:10.529 --> 06:11.863
last year's Christmas lights

06:11.864 --> 06:13.816
and put up this year's Christmas lights.

06:13.817 --> 06:16.034
Then I need you to get the
eggnog cups out of the attic

06:16.035 --> 06:17.802
and bump your head on a low eave.

06:17.803 --> 06:20.138
After that, take my
cousins to the airport

06:20.139 --> 06:21.539
and pick up my other cousins

06:21.540 --> 06:23.608
at a different, farther away airport.

06:23.609 --> 06:25.543
Then shovel and salt the walk.

06:25.544 --> 06:27.512
Then shovel and salt the driveway.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.981
Then shovel and salt Mrs.
Whitaker's driveway.

06:29.982 --> 06:32.050
She's 96 and has no one to help her.

06:32.051 --> 06:34.719
We need four netted bags
of cinnamon pinecones.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.889
Get the bags at Hobby Lobby
and the pinecones at Pier 1.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.959
Next, inflate the giant snowman
and put it on our front lawn.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.361
The pump's broken, so you'll
have to do it by mouth.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.664
Then it's just laundry,
take out the trash,

06:45.665 --> 06:47.502
and move the house a
little bit to the left.

06:47.887 --> 06:50.156
Ugh. Can I do some of that tomorrow?

06:50.157 --> 06:52.493
No, because tomorrow we're
going down to volunteer

06:52.494 --> 06:54.863
- at the homeless shelter.
- What time will you be back?

06:54.864 --> 06:56.065
You're coming with us.

06:56.066 --> 06:58.402
What? What does that have
to do with Christmas?

06:58.403 --> 07:00.404
Peter, it's a holiday of giving back.

07:00.405 --> 07:01.772
Yeah, but bums?

07:01.773 --> 07:04.241
What kind of presents would
they possibly have for us?

07:04.242 --> 07:06.343
Bags full of bags full of bags?

07:06.344 --> 07:07.844
You know what, Peter, I've had it.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.513
I'm tired of your selfishness.

07:09.514 --> 07:11.581
It's setting a bad example
for our children.

07:11.582 --> 07:13.150
Kids, get your coats!

07:13.151 --> 07:15.419
Oh, is this it? Is this the divorce?!

07:15.420 --> 07:17.421
Coats? Where are you guys going?

07:17.422 --> 07:19.823
Every year, my parents
invite us to their house

07:19.824 --> 07:21.425
to enjoy Christmas in Newport.

07:21.426 --> 07:24.194
And every year, we don't go
because you don't want to.

07:24.195 --> 07:27.264
Well, this year, I am going and
the kids are coming with me.

07:27.265 --> 07:28.598
Go ahead!

07:28.599 --> 07:30.100
I'm fine by myself!

07:30.101 --> 07:32.035
I'll just watch my Patrick Swayze movie

07:32.036 --> 07:33.838
and take a too-full bath.

07:36.608 --> 07:38.943
Aw, now I want to be on that side.

07:40.645 --> 07:42.179
Well, that didn't work.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.114
Now to take a slidey-toilet-seat,

08:23.187 --> 08:24.688
Santa?

08:24.689 --> 08:28.125
You think Santa could fit into
a pair of 22-inch-waist jeans?

08:28.126 --> 08:29.626
Patrick Swayze?

08:29.627 --> 08:31.795
How is that even possible? You're dead!

08:31.796 --> 08:33.330
Haven't you ever seen <i>Ghost?</i>

08:33.331 --> 08:34.631
Peter, you're in trouble.

08:34.632 --> 08:36.266
So, I've come back to help you

08:36.267 --> 08:38.335
recapture the true spirit of Christmas.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.239
- Ghost House.
- Road House.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.951
- Ghost Road.
- House House.

08:42.952 --> 08:43.953
Road Ghost.

08:48.447 --> 08:50.566
The ghost of Patrick Swayze!

08:50.567 --> 08:51.625
I can't believe it!

08:51.626 --> 08:53.322
I just want to run through your hair

08:53.323 --> 08:55.625
like a dog bouncing in tall grass.

08:55.626 --> 08:56.993
Go ahead.

09:00.497 --> 09:01.875
Yay!

09:06.317 --> 09:07.652
That was awesome!

09:07.653 --> 09:08.888
Hey, where are we?

09:08.889 --> 09:10.924
Peter, you've lost
your Christmas spirit,

09:10.925 --> 09:14.695
so I'm taking you on a journey
to "Christmas Past" to find it.

09:14.696 --> 09:16.029
Oh, wow.

09:16.030 --> 09:18.865
Th-This is my old house from
when I was a little kid.

09:18.866 --> 09:20.200
That's right, Peter.

09:20.201 --> 09:24.204
I've taken you all the way
back to the year 1970/80/90.

09:24.205 --> 09:26.106
I'll never forget that year,

09:26.107 --> 09:28.076
when President Richard Reagan Clinton

09:28.077 --> 09:29.853
lied to the American people.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.580
Hey, hey, that's me!

09:33.581 --> 09:35.282
Look how skinny I am.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.584
Yay! It's Christmas!

09:37.585 --> 09:41.288
And I made your favorite, peanut
butter chocolate chip cookies.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.090
Wow, these are all for me?!

09:43.091 --> 09:44.257
Of course, Petey.

09:44.258 --> 09:46.960
It's Christmas, everything's for you.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.196
Yay! Cookies at 7:00 a.m.!

09:49.197 --> 09:50.731
Thank you, careless parent!

09:50.732 --> 09:52.399
I'm gonna eat 'em and hum!

09:55.903 --> 09:58.138
See? Look how happy I was.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.906
That's the Christmas spirit.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.808
I haven't felt that in years.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.977
Yeah, looks like your mom
really went out of her way

10:03.978 --> 10:05.645
to make Christmas special for you.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.247
She sure did.

10:07.248 --> 10:08.949
Oh, hey, look, there's my friend Holden!

10:08.950 --> 10:10.472
Merry Christmas, Peter!

10:10.952 --> 10:12.385
He could still talk then.

10:12.386 --> 10:13.954
I wonder what happened to him.

10:13.955 --> 10:15.989
I gotta go! I gotta go!

10:15.990 --> 10:19.494
Hold it in! Hold it in! Hold it in!

10:21.662 --> 10:24.331
Hold it in! Hold it in!

10:24.332 --> 10:25.966
Hold it in!

10:25.967 --> 10:28.935
Hold in! Hold in!

10:28.936 --> 10:30.470
Holden.

10:30.471 --> 10:32.272
You died before <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

10:32.273 --> 10:34.442
but a-a lot of people will like that.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.613
What is this? Are we still in the past?

10:39.614 --> 10:41.348
No, this is the present.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.451
And I just want you to see
that not everyone in Quahog

10:44.452 --> 10:46.353
has lost the Christmas spirit.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.354
Christmas!

10:47.355 --> 10:48.622
- What's this?!
- Coal!

10:48.623 --> 10:49.656
- Why?!
- Bad!

10:49.657 --> 10:50.992
Aw!

10:54.529 --> 10:55.996
Ho, ho, ho!

10:59.400 --> 11:02.302
Thank you, Santa!

11:02.303 --> 11:04.037
Daddy, you missed Santa.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.205
He was right here.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.903
♪ Night... ♪

11:41.809 --> 11:44.344
Wow, no wonder I don't see
Cleveland until New Year's.

11:44.345 --> 11:45.846
At least they're together.

11:45.847 --> 11:48.583
Well, I know one family that
isn't together for Christmas.

11:54.522 --> 11:56.656
That was a delicious meal, Daddy.

11:56.657 --> 11:59.192
You all laughed when I
suggested Boston Market.

11:59.193 --> 12:00.894
Well, who's laughing now?

12:02.797 --> 12:04.030
I guess I am.

12:04.031 --> 12:05.932
All right, everyone,
grab your hot ciders

12:05.933 --> 12:07.634
and gather around the speakerphone.

12:07.635 --> 12:11.072
It's time to call my
grandmother, Nana Pewterschmidt.

12:31.325 --> 12:32.492
What did she say?

12:32.493 --> 12:34.327
She wishes you a merry Christmas.

12:34.328 --> 12:35.829
That's not what she said.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.330
Time for figgy pudding!

12:37.331 --> 12:39.666
Yay!

12:39.667 --> 12:41.668
Seems like they're having
a good time without you.

12:41.669 --> 12:43.169
Oh, they're just pretending to have fun.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.540
I'm sure they miss me.

12:44.541 --> 12:46.106
We should probably call Durd.

12:46.107 --> 12:47.741
You mean Dad?

12:47.742 --> 12:49.976
No, the fat guy who sleeps with Mom.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.728
You guys talking 'bout Durd?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.581
More champagne, miss?

12:54.582 --> 12:56.683
Miss? Oh, my!

12:56.684 --> 12:59.052
It's been a long time since
anybody's called me miss.

12:59.053 --> 13:01.688
Wow! Merry Christmas, huh?

13:01.689 --> 13:04.124
Oh, Merry Chris-miss! Ha!

13:05.593 --> 13:08.707
Oh, my God, she's doing
that flirty laugh she does.

13:08.708 --> 13:11.031
It's subtle, but when you've
been married as long as we have,

13:11.032 --> 13:12.465
you notice these things.

13:15.069 --> 13:16.636
You're very funny, Lance.

13:16.637 --> 13:18.638
You're a very handsome, funny man.

13:18.639 --> 13:20.206
Now, let's see that penis!

13:20.207 --> 13:22.242
Yeah, see, again, if you
read between the lines,

13:22.243 --> 13:23.410
she's flirting.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.487
Why, this isn't a merry
Christmas at all.

13:25.488 --> 13:27.276
I don't like anything
you're showing me, Pat...

13:27.277 --> 13:28.677
Oh, my God, they got Joe.

13:30.246 --> 13:32.181

13:41.621 --> 13:44.423
You're not scaring me with
any of this, Patrick Swayze!

13:44.424 --> 13:46.092
And no matter what you show me,

13:46.093 --> 13:48.527
there's no way my family
won't be right back here

13:48.528 --> 13:50.529
spending Christmas with me tomorrow!

13:55.900 --> 13:57.837
Wha... Wh-Wh...

13:57.838 --> 13:59.071
What's happening?

13:59.072 --> 14:01.474
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.375
I'm shaping your future.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.911
And you will see...

14:05.912 --> 14:10.416
Oops. That's what happens when
I talk while I'm doing this.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.752
Is this how Jonah Hill was made?

14:15.922 --> 14:17.756
I can't believe our buddy's dead.

14:17.757 --> 14:21.594
I know. And it's so sad, he
left his family with nothing.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.663
Yeah, Lois had to sell
her clothes to get by.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.066
I mean, I love having
this underwear, I just...

14:27.067 --> 14:29.101
I just don't love why I have it.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.036
God, it's so sad.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.272
Who's this poor Benjamin that just died?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.074
Nobody ever said Benjamin.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.509
Poor, dead Benjamin.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.010
All right, you're not getting it.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.013
Let me just take you to your house.

14:45.855 --> 14:48.120
Boy, I love the holiday
season with my husband

14:48.121 --> 14:50.523
who's right upstairs, just out of frame.

14:50.524 --> 14:51.690
Oh, am I coming down?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.259
Oh, please tell me I lost the weight

14:53.260 --> 14:54.627
and kept it off this time.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.395
Merry Christmas!

14:56.396 --> 14:57.935
Who's that guy?

14:57.936 --> 15:00.007
That's Lois's new husband, Lance.

15:00.008 --> 15:01.233
Wow.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.782
I finally had the guts to leave her.

15:03.783 --> 15:05.135
Good for you, Peter.

15:05.136 --> 15:06.639
What about the kids? How are they doing?

15:06.640 --> 15:07.907
See for yourself.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.743
All right, everybody,
I'm off to Colombia...

15:10.744 --> 15:12.390
Chris got into Columbia?

15:12.391 --> 15:13.746
South America.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.581
Where I will attempt to smuggle drugs

15:15.582 --> 15:17.917
back into the country in my rectum.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.352
Aw, I knew there was some
kind of rug-pull coming.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.755
- And I'm off to Yale...
- The lock maker?

15:22.756 --> 15:26.091
The lock maker, where I
have a minimum wage job.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.260
All right, okay, yeah, I'm-I'm
getting ahead of these.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.828
I'm going to Brown...

15:29.829 --> 15:34.066
four boxes of Jimmy Dean pure
pork sausage for my breakfast.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.735
Well, I'm proud all my kids
got into Ivy League puns,

15:36.736 --> 15:38.238
but what happened to Brian?

15:41.575 --> 15:44.077
Hey, what's Brian doing out
here in the graveyard?

15:44.078 --> 15:45.851
He usually sleeps at the foot of my bed.

15:45.852 --> 15:47.155
He still does.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.952
Oh, my God!

15:52.953 --> 15:55.387
I'm dead? But how?

15:55.388 --> 15:59.058
You died from a fire started
by your MILF-On-A-Shelf.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.150
Want to see some pictures
of my teenagers?

16:01.151 --> 16:02.162
No, Karen.

16:02.163 --> 16:03.869
Look, I haven't watered
my Christmas tree

16:03.870 --> 16:05.197
for a few weeks now, so could you watch

16:05.198 --> 16:06.699
your really long cigarette, please?

16:06.700 --> 16:09.001
Did I tell you I went to
the mall with my daughter

16:09.002 --> 16:10.903
and an employee thought we were sisters?

16:10.904 --> 16:13.072
Yes, many times.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.573
I don't understand.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.997
Why didn't someone in my family save me?

16:16.998 --> 16:20.139
They went to Newport because
you wanted to be by yourself.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.199
Remember?

16:21.200 --> 16:23.249
Looks like you got what you wanted.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.628
Oh, my God, look, it's my ghost!

16:25.629 --> 16:26.788
Not exactly.

16:26.789 --> 16:28.563
Ugh, why do I smell so bad?

16:28.564 --> 16:31.133
- Because I'm a dog fart now.
- What? Why?

16:31.134 --> 16:33.568
Because that's what happens when
you lose your Christmas spirit.

16:33.569 --> 16:35.470
You spend all of eternity as a dog fart.

16:35.471 --> 16:38.073
- Was this in the book?
- Yes, it was an obscure chapter

16:38.074 --> 16:41.243
written during Dickens' opium
and spoiled lamb phase.

16:41.244 --> 16:42.511
But how do I...

16:42.512 --> 16:44.146
Where'd... where'd he go?

16:44.147 --> 16:46.481
Don't worry, Brian's a 13-year-old dog.

16:46.482 --> 16:48.483
You're around a lot.

16:48.484 --> 16:51.253
Please, Peter, don't lose
your Christmas spirit.

16:51.254 --> 16:52.754
It's disgusting in there.

16:52.755 --> 16:55.590
He eats garbage and his own poo.

16:55.591 --> 16:58.093
Please, Peter, don't lose
your Christmas spirit.

16:58.094 --> 17:00.328
This is no life for a person.

17:00.329 --> 17:02.697
Please, Peter, he ate Lois's trash.

17:02.698 --> 17:04.866
There's tampons in there!

17:04.867 --> 17:06.535
- Please, Peter.
- Keep your Christmas spirit.

17:06.536 --> 17:08.703
- Please, Peter.
- This is no life for a person.

17:08.704 --> 17:10.839
- Please, Peter.
- I'm the tampon one.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.841
No! No!

17:12.842 --> 17:15.210
No!

17:15.211 --> 17:17.179
No, please, spirits, no.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.280
No!

17:18.281 --> 17:19.881
Wh-Where am I?

17:19.882 --> 17:21.190
What day is it?

17:22.385 --> 17:25.987
All the porn girls I follow on
Instagram have Santa hats on.

17:25.988 --> 17:27.389
It must be Christmas!

17:27.390 --> 17:29.891
Merry Christmas, P. O. V. Angie!

17:29.892 --> 17:32.160
Merry Christmas, triple-X underscore

17:32.161 --> 17:34.296
Tara Kink underscore triple-X!

17:34.297 --> 17:37.333
Merry Christmas to all the thirst traps!

17:43.406 --> 17:44.573
Thanks, Grandpa.

17:44.574 --> 17:47.142
This Christmas is
perfect, isn't it, Mom?

17:47.143 --> 17:48.910
Almost, Meg.

17:48.911 --> 17:50.078
Almost.

17:50.079 --> 17:51.513
Yeah, it is,

17:51.514 --> 17:54.416
except every time Grandpa
bends over to get a present,

17:54.417 --> 17:56.017
his robe opens up.

17:56.018 --> 17:58.820
Let's see, I think this is for Chris.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.856
Good God!

18:00.857 --> 18:03.525
Looks like two eggs in
an old handkerchief.

18:03.526 --> 18:06.027
Merry Christmas, everybody!

18:06.028 --> 18:07.413
- Peter!
- Durd!

18:07.414 --> 18:08.541
Dad!

18:08.542 --> 18:10.165
Oh, Peter, you did come.

18:10.166 --> 18:11.800
Yes, Lois, I'm here,

18:11.801 --> 18:13.928
all loaded up with Christmas spirit

18:13.929 --> 18:16.838
and a sack full of hastily
bought gifts from the CVS.

18:16.839 --> 18:19.608
For Chris, a special
<i>People</i> magazine look-back

18:19.609 --> 18:21.933
at Robin Williams, 'cause
he killed himself.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.702
Wow, look how thick the cover is.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.537
It's almost like a real book!

18:26.538 --> 18:29.574
For Stewie, a two-dollar
Styrofoam cooler.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.843
Awesome! I can probably fit 16...

18:31.844 --> 18:33.344
Oh, the top blew away.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.546
For Brian, a Rhode Island sweatshirt

18:35.547 --> 18:38.283
with both "Rhode" and
"Island" misspelled!

18:39.284 --> 18:41.285
Wow, it hurts when I put it on!

18:41.286 --> 18:43.287
And for my beloved wife,

18:43.288 --> 18:46.724
a lawn chair that was 80%
off because it's winter.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.961
Oh, Peter, I can't wait
to drink outside in this.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.965
And finally, for Meg, a clock
radio with an iPod jack

18:53.966 --> 18:56.134
for the iPods they don't make anymore.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.737
Dad, you've never bought
me anything before.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.572
Are you sure this is for me?

19:01.573 --> 19:03.241
Of course, Meg, sweetie.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.744
It's Christmas, everything is for you.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.914
I love you, Peter.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.984
I love you, too, Lois.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.354
And, Patrick Swayze,
thanks for helping me find

19:15.355 --> 19:17.234
the true spirit of Christmas.

19:17.235 --> 19:19.190
I wish there was some
way I could repay you.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.525
Who are you talking to?

19:20.526 --> 19:22.560
Well, actually, there's
one thing in heaven

19:22.561 --> 19:24.262
that Chris Farley won't do with me.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.597
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.071
Let-let's just keep opening presents.

20:07.072 --> 20:08.806
He'll tire himself out.

Great idea.
