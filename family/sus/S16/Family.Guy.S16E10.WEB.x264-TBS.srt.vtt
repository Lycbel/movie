00:34.504 --> 00:36.772
Peter, come on, time to get dressed

00:36.773 --> 00:38.340
for our Valentine's Day dinner.

00:38.341 --> 00:40.142
We don't want to be late
for our reservation.

00:40.143 --> 00:41.577
Reservation?

00:41.578 --> 00:43.946
Yeah. I decided we're going
someplace nice this time.

00:43.947 --> 00:46.749
Not like last year when we went
to the Outback Steakhouse,

00:46.750 --> 00:49.151
but it's "out" as in the gay way.

00:49.152 --> 00:52.888
We'll get to the specials,
but first, I need to tell you...

00:52.889 --> 00:54.390
I'm gay.

00:54.391 --> 00:55.658
The hell you are!

00:55.659 --> 00:57.393
No waiter of mine is gonna be gay!

00:57.394 --> 00:59.662
Peter, please. He's our waiter.

00:59.663 --> 01:01.664
He's the only waiter we have.

01:01.665 --> 01:03.899
Lois, our waiter is dead to us.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.769
We have to focus all our
attention on our hostess now.

01:06.770 --> 01:09.371
He-he just needs a little time.

01:09.372 --> 01:10.906
Scott...

01:10.907 --> 01:15.210
I'm finally ready to hear the specials.

01:15.211 --> 01:17.012
Well, happy Valentine's Day, Lois.

01:17.013 --> 01:20.182
Let's have a dying marriage
side-face kiss.

01:20.183 --> 01:21.584
Mwah.

01:21.585 --> 01:24.353
Well, I better set out
a can of tuna fish and a cigar

01:24.354 --> 01:25.854
for Arthur Valentine.

01:25.855 --> 01:28.724
I can't wait to see what he brings me.

01:28.725 --> 01:31.694
Uh, you want to tell us
what the holy hell that was?

01:31.695 --> 01:33.729
I'm afraid it's something we made up

01:33.730 --> 01:35.764
that we finally need to deal with.

01:35.765 --> 01:37.766
You see, years ago,
when Chris was in preschool...

01:42.372 --> 01:45.274
Peter, poor Chris didn't get
a single valentine today

01:45.275 --> 01:47.242
from any of his classmates.

01:47.243 --> 01:48.544
What? Why not?

01:48.545 --> 01:50.179
Apparently, he's not well liked.

01:50.180 --> 01:51.880
Some of the kids think he's weird

01:51.881 --> 01:53.782
because he takes his shirt off to pee.

01:53.783 --> 01:56.685
Yeah, I taught him that.
That's also called "peeing."

01:56.686 --> 01:58.454
Pee? Pee now?

01:58.455 --> 01:59.888
No. No, Chris.

01:59.889 --> 02:03.392
Why no valentines?

02:03.393 --> 02:05.561
Hey, hey, hey, stop crying, Chris.

02:05.562 --> 02:06.729
Y-You're gonna...

02:06.730 --> 02:09.098
Y-You're gonna get tons of valentines.

02:09.099 --> 02:11.433
I am? From who?

02:11.434 --> 02:15.270
Um, from... Arthur Valentine.

02:15.271 --> 02:16.772
R-Really?

02:16.773 --> 02:18.574
Yeah, yeah, that's right!

02:18.575 --> 02:21.210
Who's Arthur Valentine?

02:21.211 --> 02:23.412
Only the most magical man ever.

02:23.413 --> 02:26.782
And he comes every
Valentine's Day on-on a-a...

02:26.783 --> 02:29.351
a purple Vespa to, um...

02:29.352 --> 02:31.654
to bring candy and sweet notes
to children

02:31.655 --> 02:34.223
who've managed to not use
any swears in the last year.

02:34.224 --> 02:35.257
He does?

02:35.258 --> 02:37.426
Uh-huh, and he has a long beard...

02:37.427 --> 02:38.994
Oh, and-and he's got an eye patch.

02:38.995 --> 02:41.530
B-But not for medical reasons,
he just likes the look.

02:41.531 --> 02:44.066
Plus, he-he wears a Cat in the Hat hat

02:44.067 --> 02:46.568
and sometimes a scarf,
no matter what Lois says

02:46.569 --> 02:48.404
because it gives him a youthful vibe

02:48.405 --> 02:50.606
and adds some color to his face.

02:50.607 --> 02:53.275
We were just trying to cheer Chris up.

02:53.276 --> 02:55.277
I assumed he'd outgrow it
in a few years,

02:55.278 --> 02:58.113
but, Peter, it's time
we have a talk with Chris.

02:58.114 --> 03:01.116
We've got to put an end to this
Arthur Valentine nonsense.

03:01.117 --> 03:03.252
Yeah, I guess you're right.

03:03.253 --> 03:05.320
Well, I best be going anyway.

03:05.321 --> 03:07.790
Donna and I are spending
our Valentine's Day

03:07.791 --> 03:10.793
in Johnnie Cochran pajamas,
just caressing each other

03:10.794 --> 03:12.795
in a very beige bedroom.

03:12.796 --> 03:14.463
Yeah, and hopefully Bonnie and I'll

03:14.464 --> 03:16.331
do a sexy bath night like last year.

03:16.332 --> 03:17.833
It was amazing.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.135
She laid out a trail of rose petals,

03:20.136 --> 03:22.971
and I elbow-crawled
to the sponge and shower chair.

03:22.972 --> 03:25.874
I go down to the video store
and put my hand on Love Actually

03:25.875 --> 03:27.976
at the same time as a woman, and I go,

03:27.977 --> 03:31.547
"Oh, ho, ho, ho!
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!"

03:31.548 --> 03:34.950
What about you, Brian? What are
your plans for Valentine's Day?

03:34.951 --> 03:38.487
What? Oh, uh, no real plans, I guess.

03:38.488 --> 03:41.156
Ha! Looks like Brian's the only
guy with nothing going on.

03:41.157 --> 03:43.025
Hey, you can come over
to my house, Brian.

03:43.026 --> 03:44.893
I thought you had
that whole thing with Bonnie.

03:44.894 --> 03:48.397
I do, but she needs help lifting
me into the shower chair.

03:53.536 --> 03:55.003
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

03:55.004 --> 03:58.273
Our top story, today
the Quahog River was dyed red

03:58.274 --> 03:59.842
in honor of Valentine's Day.

03:59.843 --> 04:02.010
So if you're looking
to do a river murder,

04:02.011 --> 04:03.512
this could be your window.

04:03.513 --> 04:06.348
Stupid Hallmark holiday anyway.

04:06.349 --> 04:08.150
Oh, hey, Bri. How's your night going?

04:08.151 --> 04:11.386
I hope Rupert and I haven't been
too loud up there.

04:11.387 --> 04:15.023
Happy Valentine's Day!

04:15.024 --> 04:17.359
Oh, yeah, we're gonna go all night.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.529
Just leave me alone, Stewie.

04:20.530 --> 04:23.699
Well, Brian, if you're stuck
being a single loser,

04:23.700 --> 04:26.034
you might as well just embrace it.

04:26.035 --> 04:29.671
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

04:29.672 --> 04:31.106
Wait a minute. What am I thinking?

04:31.107 --> 04:34.109
Chocolate is poisonous to dogs.
I better stop or...

04:37.380 --> 04:40.816
Happy Valentine's Day!

04:40.817 --> 04:42.451
Stop the damn banging!

04:42.452 --> 04:45.888
People are trying to have
dignified relations!

04:50.860 --> 04:52.294
Oh, boy, look!

04:52.295 --> 04:55.798
Arthur Valentine brought me
plates and a salt shaker!

04:55.799 --> 04:57.466
Chris, Chris, settle down.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.368
I-It's actually time your father and I

04:59.369 --> 05:01.737
had a talk with you
about Arthur Valentine.

05:01.738 --> 05:03.238
Yeah, that's, uh, that's right.

05:03.239 --> 05:06.074
Um, son...

05:06.075 --> 05:08.477
I'm afraid Arthur Valentine isn't real.

05:08.478 --> 05:10.879
What? Not real?

05:10.880 --> 05:13.916
Then who leaves those notes
with all the misspellings?

05:13.917 --> 05:17.152
Well, first, Chris, English
is a very fluid language.

05:17.153 --> 05:19.822
We're sorry, but you're old
enough now to know the truth.

05:19.823 --> 05:22.591
He... he doesn't exist.

05:22.592 --> 05:25.994
No! You're both lying!

05:25.995 --> 05:28.163
What are we gonna do?

05:28.164 --> 05:30.599
It seems like there's
no getting through to him.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.001
You know, if Chris
is this hard to convince,

05:33.002 --> 05:35.470
we may just have to kill
Arthur Valentine.

05:35.471 --> 05:36.972
What? What do you mean?

05:36.973 --> 05:41.076
Maybe we make Chris believe
that Arthur Valentine is dead.

05:41.077 --> 05:44.513
Huh. Well, we just might have to.

05:47.483 --> 05:49.084
Hey, what's the matter, Brian?

05:49.085 --> 05:51.653
Have you fallen and can't get up?

05:51.654 --> 05:54.156
Turns out, still using
that joke is a felony.

05:54.157 --> 05:56.959
Guess I better not drop the soap.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.061
That one's the death penalty.

06:02.799 --> 06:04.032
You were very lucky.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.435
We managed to pump your stomach
just in time.

06:06.436 --> 06:07.803
Oh, thank God.

06:07.804 --> 06:10.406
I had him pump my stomach, too.
Doc, what was in there?

06:10.407 --> 06:12.247
Well, it's a pretty extensive list.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.266
I'm gonna need Billy Joel
to help me out.

06:14.267 --> 06:17.479
♪ Lots of Legos, rubber bands,
web-shooting Spider-Man ♪

06:17.480 --> 06:20.916

06:41.704 --> 06:43.639
Wow, that was great, Billy!

06:43.640 --> 06:46.708
Hey, does anyone call you
Bill Joel or William Joel?

06:46.709 --> 06:49.845
Uh, no. Does anyone call you
Petey Griffin?

06:49.846 --> 06:51.747
No, they don't, because I'm an adult,

06:51.748 --> 06:54.116
which is kind of what I was getting at.

06:58.554 --> 07:01.690
Ugh. Who sends a Christmas card
to their vet?

07:01.691 --> 07:03.892
I know. It's so lame, right?

07:03.893 --> 07:06.862
And did you see the lady outside
with the empty cat carrier?

07:06.863 --> 07:08.697
Ugh. Cry much?

07:08.698 --> 07:11.199
Yeah. Yeah, I bet she actually
thinks that thing loved her.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.769
Hey, I'm Brian.

07:13.770 --> 07:14.870
Shake.

07:14.871 --> 07:16.438
Nice to meet you. I'm Ellie.

07:16.439 --> 07:17.906
What are you in for?

07:17.907 --> 07:20.309
Uh, I got this small cut,
and they wanted to bandage it

07:20.310 --> 07:22.711
so I'd stop chewing
the crap out of my foot.

07:22.712 --> 07:25.247
Aw, that sucks. I love chewing
the crap out of my foot.

07:25.248 --> 07:26.481
I know, it's the best.

07:26.482 --> 07:28.450
But while I was here,
I also had to get...

07:32.722 --> 07:34.222
a prescription filled.

07:34.223 --> 07:35.557
Listen, I got to go.

07:35.558 --> 07:37.426
You want to continue this sometime?

07:37.427 --> 07:40.062
Let me give you my number.
It's on the back of here.

07:40.063 --> 07:41.997
- It's this.
- Got it.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.668
See you around, Brian.

07:46.669 --> 07:48.370
Definitely.

07:48.371 --> 07:50.405
Bye, Ellie.

07:50.406 --> 07:53.075
Is this the Veteran Aryan's office?

07:53.076 --> 07:55.277
No, this is the veterinarian's.

07:55.278 --> 07:58.714
I think you want the Veteran
Aryan's Center next door.

07:58.715 --> 08:02.284
Ah, I see the confusion.
This must happen all the time.

08:02.285 --> 08:03.919
We're ready for the German shepherd.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.487
Ja, that would be me.

08:05.488 --> 08:07.489
This is a very confusing lobby.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.273
Hey. Hey.

08:25.274 --> 08:28.043
You think you could be with me?
Right here? In this place?

08:28.044 --> 08:29.511
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. Sorry, Stewie.

08:29.512 --> 08:30.979
It's-it's just...

08:30.980 --> 08:34.516
I met someone amazing the other
day at the vet's office, and...

08:34.517 --> 08:36.218
Well, she's actually a dog.

08:36.219 --> 08:38.787
And it's so great dating someone
who understands

08:38.788 --> 08:41.523
why it's especially important
to walk around in a circle

08:41.524 --> 08:43.525
many, many times before lying down.

08:43.526 --> 08:45.160
So, that's who you were texting with?

08:45.161 --> 08:47.195
Sort of. I-I was just rereading
some of the texts

08:47.196 --> 08:48.697
I already sent her.

08:48.698 --> 08:50.699
That's good.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.134
You're rereading your own texts?

08:52.135 --> 08:54.002
Yeah, do you, do you not do that?

08:54.003 --> 08:56.004
Nobody does that.

09:00.943 --> 09:03.378
Golden Eagle to Red Shrew.
Ready for the plan?

09:03.379 --> 09:05.113
Come in, Red Shrew.

09:05.114 --> 09:07.783
Peter, we did not decide on those names.

09:07.784 --> 09:11.386
Chris, come down here, quick!
I see Arthur Valentine outside!

09:11.387 --> 09:13.188
I think he's come to say hi!

09:13.189 --> 09:14.189
Really?!

09:14.190 --> 09:15.490
Yeah, look.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.161
Oh, my God. Hi, Arthur!

09:19.162 --> 09:22.330
I love you so much,
and I haven't cussed once today!

09:22.331 --> 09:25.434
Dad, get the bowl of tuna
from under my bed!

09:30.239 --> 09:32.207
Arthur!

09:32.208 --> 09:34.443
Oh, my God, he's dead.

09:34.444 --> 09:35.711
He's dead!

09:39.449 --> 09:44.219
Mission accomplished, Red Shrew.
Over and out.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.154
Huh. That looks tasty.

09:47.790 --> 09:50.959
Little walkie-talkie piece.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.301
God, I forgot how much I love art.

09:59.302 --> 10:00.936
Hey, who's your favorite artist?

10:00.937 --> 10:02.738
Me? Uh...

10:04.140 --> 10:06.575
You know, I really like,
uh, that Jackson "Polack."

10:06.576 --> 10:08.910
You know, I-I know they're not
supposed to be that bright,

10:08.911 --> 10:10.779
but that was, that was
pretty genius, you know?

10:10.780 --> 10:13.615
I mean, leave it, leave it to
a Polack to just grab the paint

10:13.616 --> 10:15.617
with his hands and just start
chucking it everywhere.

10:15.618 --> 10:16.918
I mean, it's great.

10:16.919 --> 10:18.787
It's pronounced "Pollock."

10:18.788 --> 10:21.356
But, Brian, you don't
have to keep trying so hard

10:21.357 --> 10:22.524
to impress me.

10:22.525 --> 10:24.292
I already really like you.

10:24.293 --> 10:25.961
You do? Thanks.

10:25.962 --> 10:28.497
I-I really like you, too, Ellie.

10:28.498 --> 10:32.400
Truth is, I haven't felt this
way with anyone in a long time.

10:32.401 --> 10:34.336
Listen, I'm really sorry
to cut things short,

10:34.337 --> 10:36.505
but I've got to go; I have rehearsal.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.473
- Oh, what, for a play?
- No.

10:38.474 --> 10:41.710
It's kind of dumb,
but it's for a dog show.

10:41.711 --> 10:43.044
Oh, you're a show dog?

10:43.045 --> 10:45.280
No wonder you have
such a perfectly coiffed anus.

10:45.281 --> 10:46.314
Thank you.

10:46.315 --> 10:48.316
No, thank you. It's perfect.

10:48.317 --> 10:50.986
I mean, I... God, I-I bet every
time you go snaffling on it,

10:50.987 --> 10:52.821
you have to stop and admire it.

10:52.822 --> 10:53.889
Come on, now, Brian.

10:53.890 --> 10:55.757
A lady has to have a few secrets.

10:57.827 --> 10:59.995
Man, she is something else.

10:59.996 --> 11:02.998
This must be how Ronald Reagan
felt about Nancy.

11:02.999 --> 11:06.334
Nancy, will you make me
the happiest man in the world

11:06.335 --> 11:08.804
by turning a blind eye
to the AIDS crisis

11:08.805 --> 11:12.007
and ineffectually trying to warn
young people about drugs?

11:12.008 --> 11:13.008
Yes!

11:13.009 --> 11:14.676
Oh, yes, Ronnie! Yes!

11:14.677 --> 11:16.344
♪ If you're too young ♪

11:16.345 --> 11:18.980
♪ Those are both things she did! ♪

11:24.053 --> 11:26.855
Peter, I'm really worried about Chris.

11:26.856 --> 11:29.157
The shock of seeing Arthur Valentine die

11:29.158 --> 11:31.026
seems to have really gotten to him.

11:31.027 --> 11:34.196
I-I've never seen him
so depressed and catatonic.

11:34.197 --> 11:35.530
Well, you know, in Awakenings,

11:35.531 --> 11:37.766
Robin Williams tossed a baseball
to Robert De Niro,

11:37.767 --> 11:39.634
and he snapped out of it and caught it.

11:39.635 --> 11:40.936
M-Maybe we do that.

11:40.937 --> 11:43.738
Chris, you doing okay?

11:43.739 --> 11:45.407
It's Mom and Dad.

11:45.408 --> 11:47.209
We thought we'd... Awakenings!

11:47.210 --> 11:48.510
Peter, I'm not sure that's...

11:48.511 --> 11:49.511
Awakenings!

11:49.512 --> 11:50.579
You're gonna hurt him if you...

11:50.580 --> 11:51.580
Awakenings!

11:51.581 --> 11:52.981
Peter, knock it off.

11:52.982 --> 11:56.017
I never thought Chris would
take things so hard.

11:56.018 --> 11:58.854
I think we went too far
by killing Arthur Valentine.

11:58.855 --> 12:00.755
We have to bring him back to life.

12:00.756 --> 12:02.290
What? Are you serious?

12:02.291 --> 12:05.026
It's the only thing
that'll snap him out of it.

12:05.027 --> 12:07.762
Well, maybe, but what if
I try it with a basketball?

12:07.763 --> 12:09.097
Awakenings!

12:09.098 --> 12:10.765
Oh, God, that broke his nose.

12:10.766 --> 12:13.501
He didn't even flinch.
It's bad. Let's do your thing.

12:13.502 --> 12:15.737
Let's-let's twirl some
toilet paper up into his nose,

12:15.738 --> 12:18.340
and-and then when...
we'll-we'll do your thing.

12:22.245 --> 12:23.879
Wow, thanks again.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.580
What a nice dinner.

12:25.581 --> 12:27.716
I'm so lucky to have met you, Brian.

12:27.717 --> 12:29.751
You're such an amazing guy.

12:29.752 --> 12:32.087
I'd say we're both lucky.

12:32.088 --> 12:33.388
Oh, no, no, no, wait!

12:33.389 --> 12:35.123
Don't-don't do that.

12:35.124 --> 12:36.725
What-what? What's the matter?

12:36.726 --> 12:38.393
Oh, brutal.

12:38.394 --> 12:41.062
Yeah, that's gonna be
a terrible car ride, man.

12:41.063 --> 12:44.065
I would hate to be you, and I'm me.

12:44.066 --> 12:45.433
I'm really sorry, Brian.

12:45.434 --> 12:47.435
It's not that I don't want to kiss you.

12:47.436 --> 12:50.939
I smell the poop on your breath,
and then that's all I want,

12:50.940 --> 12:53.074
but my owners made an arrangement

12:53.075 --> 12:55.410
with the organizers
of the next dog show.

12:55.411 --> 12:58.113
They paid a lot of money
to schedule me to breed

12:58.114 --> 13:00.815
with whichever male dog
wins the competition.

13:00.816 --> 13:03.752
What, like... like breed breed?

13:03.753 --> 13:05.420
I know it might seem odd to you,

13:05.421 --> 13:07.989
but this happens in the dog show world.

13:07.990 --> 13:10.825
I have to have sex with
whichever male dog wins,

13:10.826 --> 13:12.527
whoever that ends up being.

13:15.064 --> 13:18.400
Stewie, we're entering a dog show!

13:18.401 --> 13:20.168
- Where's Stewie?
- He ate me!

13:20.169 --> 13:22.337
- I ate him.
- ♪ He ate Stewie, holy crap ♪

13:22.338 --> 13:23.939
♪ Family Guy will be right back! ♪

13:30.269 --> 13:32.108
All right Brian,
now if we're going to get you

13:32.109 --> 13:33.608
ready to compete in that dog show,

13:33.609 --> 13:35.276
we've got a lot of training to cover.

13:35.277 --> 13:37.445
Let's begin by doing
some work with the clicker.

13:37.446 --> 13:38.947
Oh, yeah, I've seen these.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.949
You click it when
you want me to do a trick,

13:40.950 --> 13:43.051
and then I get a treat,
so I associate the two.

13:43.052 --> 13:45.286
No. I use it to punctuate my jokes.

13:45.287 --> 13:48.356
Now, Brian you've got to roll
over and be good on all fours.

13:48.357 --> 13:50.458
If Nathan Lane can do it, so can you.

13:50.459 --> 13:52.360
Okay.

13:52.361 --> 13:54.929
But maybe we should just focus
on getting ready for the show.

13:54.930 --> 13:56.631
Well, look who wants to be prepared.

13:56.632 --> 13:58.967
You're a regular Beagle Scout.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.870
Wait, shouldn't I be the one
who clicks if I like the joke?

14:01.871 --> 14:03.872
You can't just click
after everything you say.

14:03.873 --> 14:06.474
If it's funny, I can.
And so far, they've all landed.

14:06.475 --> 14:09.310
Unlike the planes on 9/11.

14:09.311 --> 14:10.845
See? No click.

14:10.846 --> 14:12.680
That one was in poor taste. Not funny.

14:12.681 --> 14:14.983
You know, I was supposed to be
on one of those planes.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.284
Yeah, me, too.

14:21.824 --> 14:24.492
Um, yes. Brian Griffin.

14:24.493 --> 14:25.660
Brian?

14:25.661 --> 14:27.328
What are you doing here?

14:27.329 --> 14:28.663
Oh, hey!

14:28.664 --> 14:30.999
Uh, you know, I...
You-you just made dog shows

14:31.000 --> 14:33.902
sound so fun the other day,
I-I thought I'd give it a try.

14:33.903 --> 14:36.371
Who knows? Maybe I'll end up top dog.

14:36.372 --> 14:38.072
And on top of you.

14:38.073 --> 14:39.641
Thanks, Stewie.

14:39.642 --> 14:42.443
Brian, most of these dogs
have been training since birth.

14:42.444 --> 14:44.012
Are you sure you're ready for this?

14:44.013 --> 14:46.514
You bet I am.
I've never been so prepared.

14:46.515 --> 14:48.216
I'm a regular Beagle Scout.

14:52.521 --> 14:53.855
That's hilarious.

14:53.856 --> 14:55.089
Good luck, Brian.

15:02.998 --> 15:05.066
Chris, you got to snap out of this.

15:05.067 --> 15:08.069
I mean, I've been where you're at.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.705
Listen, I've never told anyone this,

15:10.706 --> 15:13.908
but I killed a jaywalker in 2002.

15:13.909 --> 15:16.377
She looked old, but she was only 51.

15:16.378 --> 15:18.379
I mean, back then, that was old to me.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.449
It's why I always talk
and ask questions so much.

15:21.450 --> 15:25.220
When there's any moment
of quiet, I think about her.

15:25.221 --> 15:27.655
That's why all mothers do that.

15:27.656 --> 15:31.192
Every mother has killed someone.

15:31.193 --> 15:33.094
Now drink your ginger ale.

15:33.095 --> 15:34.395
Hey, hey, hey!

15:34.396 --> 15:35.997
It's Arthur Valentine,

15:35.998 --> 15:38.466
here to accelerate awkwardly
into a bush.

15:39.935 --> 15:41.769
Damn it!

15:44.106 --> 15:46.641
Arthur...

15:46.642 --> 15:48.409
Valentine?

15:48.410 --> 15:50.545
Chris! You're okay!

15:50.546 --> 15:52.747
But I saw him die.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.916
That can only mean one thing.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.751
He must be a zombie!

15:56.752 --> 15:58.786
What? No! No, no. What?!

16:01.090 --> 16:02.323
Stop!

16:02.324 --> 16:03.591
What the hell are you doing?!

16:04.660 --> 16:06.094
I've seen The Walking Dead!

16:06.095 --> 16:07.629
I have to destroy your brain

16:07.630 --> 16:09.764
and then talk about it
for the next hour!

16:09.765 --> 16:11.232
- Chris, take it easy!
- Get off of him!

16:11.233 --> 16:13.193
- You're gonna kill me!
- It's not what you think!

16:14.937 --> 16:16.070
Dad?

16:16.071 --> 16:17.505
But... I don't...

16:17.506 --> 16:18.773
I... How did...

16:18.774 --> 16:20.942
I'm not Arthur Valentine, son.

16:20.943 --> 16:22.810
We're so sorry, Chris.

16:22.811 --> 16:24.779
Now do you understand?

16:24.780 --> 16:27.448
There is no Arthur Valentine?

16:27.449 --> 16:29.717
We never meant to hurt you, buddy.

16:33.289 --> 16:36.291
Valentine's Day would
take on new meaning for Chris

16:36.292 --> 16:37.992
in the years to come,

16:37.993 --> 16:42.330
but he would remember none
so bittersweetly as this one.

16:42.331 --> 16:45.934
This is Joe Swanson, signing off.

16:45.935 --> 16:47.468
Joe, your mom died.

16:47.469 --> 16:49.070
Seriously?

16:55.678 --> 16:58.046
How you doing? You feeling good?

16:58.047 --> 17:00.682
Because this thing is gonna
come down to the arbitrary whims

17:00.683 --> 17:02.350
of whatever elderly volunteers

17:02.351 --> 17:04.786
were able to get transportation
here on a Tuesday.

17:04.787 --> 17:06.554
Yeah, I... Hey, watch it!

17:06.555 --> 17:08.156
The hell's his problem?

17:08.157 --> 17:09.724
Careful. That's your competition.

17:09.725 --> 17:11.125
His name's Max.

17:11.126 --> 17:14.228
He's a four-time winner
and kind of a crowd favorite.

17:18.867 --> 17:20.868
Okay, who wants to start the dog show?

17:20.869 --> 17:22.403
Who wants to start it?

17:22.404 --> 17:24.672
Yes, you all want to start
the dog show, don't you?

17:24.673 --> 17:27.508
Don't you?

17:27.509 --> 17:30.278
♪

17:46.195 --> 17:49.297
♪

18:10.386 --> 18:12.353
That'll do it for the males.

18:12.354 --> 18:14.255
And as our judges tabulate the results,

18:14.256 --> 18:16.891
we can now announce our female division.

18:16.892 --> 18:19.727
The winning bitch,
for the tenth year in a row,

18:19.728 --> 18:21.896
is Katherine Heigl!

18:21.897 --> 18:23.664
Thank you, thank you.

18:23.665 --> 18:26.968
No, but for real,
it's that dog Ellie over there.

18:31.106 --> 18:34.942
And our winner
in the male division is...

18:34.943 --> 18:36.711
Brian Griffin!

18:36.712 --> 18:38.646
Yes!

18:43.752 --> 18:45.620
Man, thank you for
all your help, Stewie.

18:45.621 --> 18:46.821
I really couldn't have done it...

18:46.822 --> 18:48.256
What the... What's going on?

18:51.760 --> 18:53.761
This-this is it?

18:53.762 --> 18:56.097
It's happening right here? Right now?

18:56.098 --> 18:58.766
Uh-huh. They have to certify
the union, Brian.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.268
Stud is ready to mount.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.636
Please turn up the lights.

19:01.637 --> 19:03.771
What? No! No, the opposite!

19:03.772 --> 19:05.306
In fact, could someone maybe turn on

19:05.307 --> 19:07.275
some-some Drake or The Weekend?

19:07.276 --> 19:09.710
Ha! He's blowing it! He can't do it!

19:09.711 --> 19:11.646
Quagmire?! What are you doing here?

19:11.647 --> 19:13.081
Oh, I have an all-access pass

19:13.082 --> 19:15.249
to anything in this town
that's sex-related.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.617
Offering manual assistance.

19:16.618 --> 19:17.718
Commencing union.

19:17.719 --> 19:19.954
Okay, okay, thanks, man, but, yeah, no,

19:19.955 --> 19:21.456
I-I got this, I got this.

19:21.457 --> 19:23.424
If-if you just-just give me
a second to get, like,

19:23.425 --> 19:24.792
a scenario in my head.

19:24.793 --> 19:28.590
Uh, maybe a hot babysitter
who needs to pay for college

19:28.591 --> 19:29.764
so she, uh...

19:29.765 --> 19:31.766
Can somebody please shut those dogs up?!

19:31.767 --> 19:34.302
This specimen is unable to perform.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.736
Please bring in the boxer.

19:40.275 --> 19:42.276
I'm sorry, Brian, but this is

19:42.277 --> 19:43.978
what I was trying to tell you.

19:43.979 --> 19:47.148
I'm sorry, too, but I see now
that you were right.

19:47.149 --> 19:48.983
I'm just not sure how this could work

19:48.984 --> 19:51.819
or-or how our relationship
could fit into your world.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.354
Hey, less talk!

19:53.355 --> 19:55.223
I guess this is good-bye.

19:55.224 --> 19:56.557
I guess it is.

19:56.558 --> 19:58.659
I'll always remember you, Brian.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.595
And I'll always remember you, Ellie.

20:00.596 --> 20:03.865
I promise to name
one of the puppies after you.

20:03.866 --> 20:06.400
Let's just cross our fingers...

20:06.401 --> 20:08.603
it's not one of the ones he eats.

20:08.604 --> 20:10.037
Thanks. That means a lot...

20:10.038 --> 20:12.006
Okay, we're at the part
where he bites down

20:12.007 --> 20:14.542
on the back of my neck, so we
should probably wrap this up.

20:14.543 --> 20:15.810
Yup.

20:15.811 --> 20:19.046
Whoa! Max's grandfather
may have been a horse.

20:19.047 --> 20:20.581
Come on, let's just go home.

20:20.582 --> 20:22.183
Okay.

20:22.184 --> 20:25.186
Is this the romantic ending
you were hoping for?

20:25.187 --> 20:27.355
Look, that was a tricky
situation, all right?

20:27.356 --> 20:29.357
The lights, the people watching.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.058
If-if it hadn't been for all that, I...

20:31.059 --> 20:33.828
