Hi there. It's me, Peter.

00:31.981 --> 00:34.714
You know, when it comes
to making dreams come alive,

00:34.750 --> 00:37.016
there used to be nothing
like the movies.

00:37.052 --> 00:38.451
So we thought it would
be fun to ask

00:38.487 --> 00:41.854
a few visionary Hollywood
directors to create his...

00:41.890 --> 00:43.290
let's be honest, his...

00:43.326 --> 00:46.359
own unique version of
the same Family Guy story:

00:46.395 --> 00:48.027
"Peter Gets Fired."

00:48.063 --> 00:50.096
Of the countless
directors we contacted,

00:50.132 --> 00:52.364
three did not
say no immediately,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.867
and I got a weird message
from Paul Verhoeven

00:54.903 --> 00:56.802
that I could not understand.

I've had enough
of your nonsense.

02:02.138 --> 02:05.639
Here's Christoph Waltz
to fire you in a weird accent.

02:05.675 --> 02:08.844
Yer fi-YERD!

02:22.057 --> 02:23.425
It's a cliché.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.294
You think you can fire me?

02:27.330 --> 02:30.462
I'm taking this keg as payback.

02:34.870 --> 02:37.674
Cinema is an event.

02:59.628 --> 03:02.798
- Where's my family?
- Dead. All of them.

03:20.483 --> 03:22.115

- It's whatever year

to watch television.

03:30.325 --> 03:31.758
Well, can I go home?

03:31.794 --> 03:32.925

really ready,

03:32.961 --> 03:34.060

03:34.096 --> 03:35.527
you can stab me
with this scalpel

03:35.563 --> 03:37.229
- and then run out.
- Thanks.

03:37.265 --> 03:39.699
Oh, that was
unnecessary but cool.

03:39.735 --> 03:41.571
So awesome!

03:55.318 --> 03:56.920

Welcome back
to our special episode,

07:16.522 --> 07:18.356
featuring
famous directors' versions

07:18.392 --> 07:21.714
of the same Family Guy story,
"Peter Gets Fired."

07:21.750 --> 07:23.549
I'm still here
in front of the Hollywood Sign,

07:23.585 --> 07:25.565
but I've asked the cameraman
to adjust the shot

07:25.601 --> 07:27.261
so that you can only see "wood."

07:27.297 --> 07:29.031
I thought
that would be hilarious.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.948
You know why?
'Cause of boners.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.767
Anyway, our next director
is Wes Anderson,

07:33.803 --> 07:36.103
a guy who makes you feel
like you ate a pot brownie

07:36.139 --> 07:38.475
and woke up in a greeting card.

07:57.427 --> 07:58.559
Mmm.

07:58.595 --> 08:00.293
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

08:00.329 --> 08:03.663
On a March day, with
a temperature of 64 degrees,

08:03.699 --> 08:05.966
my father lost his position

08:06.002 --> 08:08.136
with the Pawtucket Brothers
Brewery Company,

08:08.172 --> 08:10.303
near our village
in central Quahogia.

08:10.339 --> 08:14.074
Needless to say, it would
change our lives forever.

08:14.110 --> 08:16.143
What does it say?
I can't read spaghetti.

08:16.179 --> 08:18.146
You're relieved
of your position.

08:18.182 --> 08:20.647
I see.
And what's to happen to my play?

08:20.683 --> 08:22.683
The opening is only days away.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.819
The play's off.

08:24.855 --> 08:26.686
With no discernible reaction,

08:26.722 --> 08:30.794
my father made his way home to
deliver the news to my mother.

08:47.144 --> 08:49.109
Let me tell you about my house.

08:49.145 --> 08:50.744
We lived
in a New England cottage

08:50.780 --> 08:53.180
that was inside
a vintage Army tent,

08:53.216 --> 08:55.583
that was inside
a decommissioned submarine,

08:55.619 --> 08:59.389
that was all inside
an old airplane hangar.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.458
I've lost my position

09:03.494 --> 09:05.526
with the Pawtucket Brothers
Brewery Company.

09:05.562 --> 09:07.094
And the play is off.

09:08.932 --> 09:11.469
We have to inform the children.

09:13.504 --> 09:14.935
My brother Chris
had spent his life

09:14.971 --> 09:16.704
conjoining his twin loves,

09:16.740 --> 09:18.705
medicine and escape artistry.

09:18.741 --> 09:20.373
Eureka.

09:20.409 --> 09:22.477
A possible cure.

09:31.087 --> 09:34.755
Do you want to do
a Spider-Man kiss?

09:34.791 --> 09:38.593
Our dog Brian had been
making a name for himself

09:38.629 --> 09:41.599
on the pickleball court.

09:47.104 --> 09:49.874
And that's match
for Gene Porterfield.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.511
Are those marking sole shoes?

09:55.879 --> 09:58.079
I'd like to officially file
a grievance.

09:58.115 --> 10:00.414
Brian had quietly become
the most successful

10:00.450 --> 10:02.787
grievance filer
in league history.

10:04.453 --> 10:06.420
I'll be there right away.

10:06.456 --> 10:08.856
The exterior of our
house is a lighthouse now.

10:08.892 --> 10:10.190
Inside's the same.

10:10.226 --> 10:12.196
Okay, back to the story.

10:13.563 --> 10:15.262
I've summoned you all
and arranged you

10:15.298 --> 10:17.297
in a perfectly symmetrical form
in front of me

10:17.333 --> 10:19.132
to tell you some important news.

10:19.168 --> 10:21.868
I've been relieved
of my position at the brewery.

10:21.904 --> 10:23.103
What of the play?

10:23.139 --> 10:25.439
The play is postponed,
indefinitely.

10:25.475 --> 10:26.641
No, Mr. Griffin.

10:26.677 --> 10:28.108
You need to do this play.

10:28.144 --> 10:29.276
We'll help you.

10:29.312 --> 10:30.944
But I've lost access
to the brewery.

10:30.980 --> 10:32.780
That's where the whole piece
is set.

10:32.816 --> 10:34.614
Maybe it doesn't have to be.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.717
But that's where
the free tape and paper is.

10:36.753 --> 10:38.685
I'll buy you new tape and paper.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.787
The play is back on.

10:40.823 --> 10:43.457
On an overcast
Thursday afternoon,

10:43.493 --> 10:45.560
my father presented his play,

10:45.596 --> 10:48.462
one of the most compelling
stories of the 1980s,

10:48.498 --> 10:50.568
Max Dugan Returns.

10:51.601 --> 10:54.035
Max, you've returned!

10:54.071 --> 10:55.339
I have.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.809
This took a lot of work.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.818
My father passed away
in the spring of his 43rd year,

11:10.854 --> 11:14.321
and was put to rest
in the family graveyard.

11:14.357 --> 11:17.257
He died chasing a Pokémon
across a busy street.

11:27.868 --> 11:29.379
Hey there. It's me again.

11:29.415 --> 11:31.247
Wouldn't it be great
if Wes Anderson's movies

11:31.283 --> 11:33.083
were actually that short?

11:33.119 --> 11:36.352
Anyway, the Hollywood Sign
is more historic than you think.

11:36.388 --> 11:39.055
On this very spot, 52 years ago,

11:39.091 --> 11:41.558
a piece of beef jerky
was planted in the ground

11:41.594 --> 11:43.260
and watered with Red Bull.

11:43.296 --> 11:45.495
A speedboat erupted
from the soil,

11:45.531 --> 11:48.664
and in that speedboat...
was Michael Bay.

12:28.173 --> 12:30.473
This already doesn't make sense.

12:55.468 --> 12:56.799
You're fired, Griffin,

12:56.835 --> 12:58.635
for destroying
company property.

12:58.671 --> 13:00.337
Tell it to my tongue.

13:12.819 --> 13:14.851
Mr. President,
we have a situation.

13:14.887 --> 13:18.588
The Decepticons plan to destroy
the Seven Wonders of the World,

13:18.624 --> 13:20.756
starting with the Hagia Sophia.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.959
The what? Is that even
one of the Seven Wonders?

13:23.995 --> 13:27.030
The Decepticons
have only one weakness.

13:27.066 --> 13:28.765
They're allergic to beer.

13:28.801 --> 13:31.034
I don't like the taste
either so much.

13:31.070 --> 13:33.303
That chest plate is
where they're most vulnerable.

13:33.339 --> 13:35.838
If we could find someone
strong enough to throw a keg

13:35.874 --> 13:38.442
with enough force,
we might have a shot.

13:41.647 --> 13:43.980
The only problem is,
there's not a man alive

13:44.016 --> 13:46.987
who can throw a keg
with that kind of force.

13:47.986 --> 13:50.187
There may be one.

13:50.223 --> 13:52.488
I wonder who it is.

13:56.495 --> 13:59.996
Our top story: stopping
the Decepticons with beer?

14:00.032 --> 14:01.464
According to our sources,

14:01.500 --> 14:04.333
the search is underway
for a man strong enough

14:04.369 --> 14:06.837
to throw a keg
with enough force

14:06.873 --> 14:08.472
to save
the Seven Wonders of the World.

14:12.611 --> 14:14.644
What took you so long?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.880
There was a train and
I like to count the cars.

14:16.916 --> 14:17.881
It was a big one.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.082
Me, too. That is fun.

14:19.118 --> 14:20.817
But you're wasting
your time coming here.

14:20.853 --> 14:23.019
I don't throw kegs anymore.

14:25.858 --> 14:27.022
Who's this?

14:27.058 --> 14:28.991
What are you wearing?
That's my funeral shirt.

14:29.027 --> 14:31.261
Look, Peter, I didn't want
to ask you to do this

14:31.297 --> 14:33.563
because of that maverick
but awesome thing you did

14:33.599 --> 14:35.498
in the battle war of the past.

14:35.534 --> 14:37.934
Is this the stuff you didn't
want me to ask you about?

14:37.970 --> 14:39.602
I told you not to
ask me about that.

14:39.638 --> 14:42.204
He went rogue
and saved everyone's lives,

14:42.240 --> 14:43.839
but he didn't do it
by the book.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.674
Is that why he can't
get an erection?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.343
Everyone stop talking about me!

14:47.379 --> 14:49.780
Listen,
it's not me that's asking,

14:49.816 --> 14:51.247
it's America.

14:53.219 --> 14:56.185
Tell America my answer is "no."

14:56.221 --> 14:58.454
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go change my mind

15:22.181 --> 15:23.583
Hold on!

15:24.584 --> 15:25.881
Damn it, I'm in.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.418
But I do things my way,
and I pick my crew.

15:28.454 --> 15:31.121
Deal. Now let me sit sideways
on your motorcycle

15:31.157 --> 15:34.123
like a Vietnamese woman,
and let's get out of here.

15:46.037 --> 15:49.676
Still trying to put the world
back together, I see.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.075
Hello, Peter.

15:53.111 --> 15:54.310
We're not
joining your team.

15:54.346 --> 15:55.679
I'm putting
together a team.

15:55.715 --> 15:57.079
- We're in.
- Good.

15:57.115 --> 15:59.119
Let's shake hands
like tough guys.

16:00.452 --> 16:03.453
Some of your sweat
went in my mouth.

16:12.465 --> 16:14.197
Oh, hello, Peter.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.433
I was just out back
working in the garden.

16:16.469 --> 16:17.434
Oh, yeah?

16:17.470 --> 16:18.968
Trying to grow some balls?

16:19.004 --> 16:21.103
Okay, okay.

16:21.139 --> 16:22.439
Play nice, boys.

16:26.979 --> 16:29.945
Love the cookie-cutter house
you and Poindexter got here.

16:29.981 --> 16:32.115
Never pegged you
for a burbs dweller.

16:32.151 --> 16:33.783
Peter, you used to live here.

16:33.819 --> 16:35.017
That was a long time ago.

16:35.053 --> 16:36.553
It was two months ago.

16:36.589 --> 16:37.853
Two months is a long time

16:37.889 --> 16:40.623
when you don't sleep
and only eat ground beef.

16:40.659 --> 16:42.391
Did you tell Chris
about my mission?

16:42.427 --> 16:44.460
I thought you should.

16:44.496 --> 16:45.829
This is my favorite

16:45.865 --> 16:47.796
out of all the Seven
Wonders of the World.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.900
The Hagia Sophia.

16:49.936 --> 16:53.135
It's like God made
a basilica for himself.

16:53.171 --> 16:55.337
Dad, nothing bad
will ever happen

16:55.373 --> 16:57.573
to the Hagia Sophia, right?

16:57.609 --> 17:00.746
Not on my watch.

17:02.615 --> 17:04.581
The Decepticons' second target

17:04.617 --> 17:05.582
has been announced.

17:05.618 --> 17:07.150
It's Machu Picchu.

17:08.387 --> 17:10.419
City in the clouds.

17:10.455 --> 17:12.091
Inca Empire.

17:15.727 --> 17:18.827
When did our kids get so
obsessed with the Seven Wonders?

17:18.863 --> 17:21.264
They learned it from you.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.766
Got to go, babe.

17:23.802 --> 17:25.768
Pete.

17:25.804 --> 17:28.608
Save that (bleep) basilica.

17:47.661 --> 17:50.561
According to the calculations
on my Microsoft Surface,

17:50.597 --> 17:52.963
they have advanced
cloaking technology.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.799
The Microsoft Surface
confirms it.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.167
Microsoft Surface.

17:56.203 --> 17:59.707
My Samsung Gear S2 watch
says the same thing.

18:19.727 --> 18:24.162
We came from outer space
to step on church stuff.

18:24.198 --> 18:25.564
That does it.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.032
Let's have a fight with so many
quick shots and close-ups,

18:28.068 --> 18:29.701
you can't tell what's going on.

18:29.737 --> 18:32.369

18:32.405 --> 18:36.508

19:21.521 --> 19:22.554
Peter, don't.

19:22.590 --> 19:24.155
It's suicide.

19:24.191 --> 19:27.392
Take care of my kids' bikes.

19:27.428 --> 19:28.930
They're expensive.

20:00.795 --> 20:01.960
Oh, my God!

20:01.996 --> 20:04.162
I can't believe
Peter's gone.

20:04.198 --> 20:06.932
I never got to repeat to him
the line he said to me

20:06.968 --> 20:09.433
earlier in the film
that has taken on new meaning

20:09.469 --> 20:12.937
in the context
of all that has happened.

20:19.980 --> 20:23.647
Today is the day we honor
the late Peter Griffin,

20:23.683 --> 20:27.655
the hero who saved the
Seven Wonders of the World.

20:35.328 --> 20:37.431
Who's that
ugly son of a bitch?

20:40.267 --> 20:42.400
Peter, you're alive.

20:42.436 --> 20:43.567
But-but how?

20:43.603 --> 20:45.804
You were blown
into a million pieces.

20:45.840 --> 20:49.411
Luckily, I know a couple
of pretty good welders.

20:52.113 --> 20:54.346
Wait, they-they
welded you back together?

20:54.382 --> 20:56.847
A-And they knew you were
alive the whole time?

20:56.883 --> 21:00.454
You want to ask questions or you
want to do it in a cemetery?

21:05.484 --> 21:08.117
Is... is everything all right?

21:08.153 --> 21:09.618
Yeah, no,
I-I think I'm just tired

21:09.654 --> 21:11.320
from all the flying
back and forth.

21:11.356 --> 21:13.455
Maybe we just talk here
for a little bit,

21:13.491 --> 21:16.125
and then you can tell everyone
that I functioned as I should.

21:16.161 --> 21:18.494
Yeah, uh, okay.

21:18.530 --> 21:20.195
So, which director thing
was your favorite?

21:20.231 --> 21:21.998
Mine was this one.

21:22.034 --> 21:25.338
Oh, honestly, I-I didn't
care for the episode.
