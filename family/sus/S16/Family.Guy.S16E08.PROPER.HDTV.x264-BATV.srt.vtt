Hey, Meg. What are you up to?

00:36.943 --> 00:38.943
Not much. Just finished
an angel food cake.

00:38.979 --> 00:42.214
Might go out to the trash, see
if there's any possums to kiss.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.018
I was just out there.

00:45.952 --> 00:47.385
Oh, come on,
it's your senior year.

00:47.421 --> 00:49.454
Somebody must be having a party
or something.

00:49.490 --> 00:50.755
Well, there's one.

00:50.791 --> 00:52.757
But... I wasn't invited.

00:52.793 --> 00:54.091
Well, so what? Go crash it.

00:54.127 --> 00:55.627
Nah. Not my style.

00:55.663 --> 00:59.231
And what do you care?
Do you want the TV or something?

00:59.267 --> 01:02.833
What? No, no. I want...
I want to see you have fun.

01:02.869 --> 01:05.770
Come on, you should go,
you know? Let loose a little.

01:05.806 --> 01:07.805
You know what? You're right.

01:07.841 --> 01:09.907
Maybe I <i>will</i> give it a shot.

01:09.943 --> 01:11.109
Yeah. How awkward could it be?

01:11.145 --> 01:12.910
Can't be worse
than waving at someone

01:12.946 --> 01:14.782
who doesn't wave back at you.

01:18.052 --> 01:20.017
- No, not <i>you.</i>
- Oh. Sorry.

01:20.053 --> 01:22.086
In fact, everyone <i>but</i> you.

01:22.122 --> 01:23.755
Hi, everyone but him!

01:23.791 --> 01:25.560
Hi!

01:28.628 --> 01:31.963
Lou, I like you a lot, but
I-I think that's the last tape

01:31.999 --> 01:34.698
of you having sex with
your girlfriend I want to see.

01:34.734 --> 01:35.966
Suit yourself.

01:36.002 --> 01:38.502
All right, I got to get over
to my mom's wake.

01:38.538 --> 01:39.838
Oh, right, yeah. Crap.

01:39.874 --> 01:40.972
Ugh. Sorry again.

01:41.008 --> 01:42.940
- Oof. Cancer.
- Car accident.

01:42.976 --> 01:44.776
No, I know, I just, I'm...

01:44.812 --> 01:47.011
saying it feels like
everyone's getting cancer.

01:47.047 --> 01:48.883
You know, Bowie.

01:54.021 --> 01:57.159
Time to get <i>creepay...</i>

01:59.527 --> 02:01.595
Huh. Kid family.

02:12.005 --> 02:14.008
What a scumbag.

02:17.944 --> 02:18.976
Aw...

02:20.748 --> 02:22.646
Because I'm working all day!

02:22.682 --> 02:25.849
Oh, yeah? Well, here's what
I think of your stupid work!

02:25.885 --> 02:27.319
Don't you do that!

02:27.355 --> 02:29.090
Fiona, don't you...

02:31.458 --> 02:33.158
Is that Principal Shepherd?

02:33.194 --> 02:36.061
Wow, that looks like
a rocky relationship.

02:36.097 --> 02:38.099
"Rocky relationship."

02:40.234 --> 02:41.802
Ha-ha!

02:44.772 --> 02:46.938
Oh, come on, Brian.

02:46.974 --> 02:48.272
Don't comment or like it.

02:48.308 --> 02:51.075
It's a hard lesson,
but one he has to learn.

03:03.324 --> 03:07.192
All right, ladies,
time to mingle.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.027
Hey. You guys
talking <i>Big Bang</i> over here?

03:10.063 --> 03:11.428
<i>Big Bang Theory?</i>

03:11.464 --> 03:13.765
No? Any Bangers over here?

03:13.801 --> 03:15.133
No?

03:15.169 --> 03:16.700
Well, I've tried everything.

03:16.736 --> 03:19.204
We just don't have anything
in common with these guys.

03:19.240 --> 03:23.645
Maybe... we don't need
anything in common with them.

03:26.647 --> 03:28.879
Meg, come on, don't go crazy.

03:28.915 --> 03:30.585
Damn, that's hot!

03:32.486 --> 03:34.085
That was just lucky.

03:34.121 --> 03:35.790
Oh, yeah?

03:39.527 --> 03:42.259
Wow! Meg's so good
at casually tossing bottles

03:42.295 --> 03:44.295
over her shoulder
so they land upright!

03:44.331 --> 03:45.963
And that's very popular
right now,

03:45.999 --> 03:48.432
because we've
run out of things on Earth.

03:48.468 --> 03:50.769
Meg, that was amazing!

03:50.805 --> 03:52.937
What can I say?
I'm full of surprises.

03:52.973 --> 03:55.507
Like the end
of <i>The Usual Suspects.</i>

04:01.948 --> 04:04.952
He was gay the whole time!

04:11.491 --> 04:13.024
Okay, they're obviously home.

04:13.060 --> 04:16.094
You'd have to be dumb
to try to rob <i>that</i> place.

04:18.332 --> 04:20.832
Oh, yes!

04:28.676 --> 04:30.678
I hate the guy, but he's good.

04:38.719 --> 04:39.883
Oh, my God.

04:39.919 --> 04:42.721
What the... what the hell
is going on over there?

04:42.757 --> 04:44.955
Did he...

04:44.991 --> 04:47.224
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Stewie, it's me.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.460
You got a second?

04:48.496 --> 04:49.794
<i>Brian? Hang on.</i>

04:49.830 --> 04:51.462
<i>Hey, keep it down,
you screwballs.</i>

04:51.498 --> 04:53.530
<i>Here, let me just go
somewhere a little quieter.</i>

04:53.566 --> 04:56.200
Oh, yeah, right. <i>I'm</i> the screwball.

04:56.236 --> 04:58.303
You and friends
say "screwball" a lot.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.739
That's what happens when
you run with a screwy crowd.

05:00.775 --> 05:01.806
What's up with you?

05:01.842 --> 05:02.840
Stewie, I think...

05:02.876 --> 05:05.577
I think Principal Shepherd
killed his wife.

05:05.613 --> 05:07.010
What? What are you
talking about?

05:07.046 --> 05:09.179
I think I saw him
getting rid of her body.

05:09.215 --> 05:11.315
And carrying a bag
with something heavy in it.

05:11.351 --> 05:13.885
And... and there was red liquid
dripping from it.

05:13.921 --> 05:15.419
Okay, I've got to see this
for myself.

05:15.455 --> 05:17.054
Don't do anything.
I'm coming over.

05:17.090 --> 05:18.489
Hey, listen,
you-you don't think...

05:18.525 --> 05:20.525
you don't think you
could snag a couple of rolls

05:20.561 --> 05:22.229
of toilet paper, could you?

05:23.630 --> 05:26.164
- Stewie?
- <i>I'm here. I just wanted you</i>

05:26.200 --> 05:28.702
<i>to have to sit with those words
for a minute.</i>

05:32.072 --> 05:33.837
Kids, dinner's ready!

05:33.873 --> 05:34.905
"Dinner's ready."

05:34.941 --> 05:36.207
Shut up.

05:36.243 --> 05:39.279
Little of the old schnappster
ought to get me right.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.546
'Ey... Chrissay!

05:42.582 --> 05:45.015
Well, that's
delightfully informal, Meg.

05:45.051 --> 05:46.921
How the heck are ya?

05:49.789 --> 05:51.890
So, what are you kids
doing in school?

05:51.926 --> 05:54.125
I got in trouble for saying
something "insensitive"

05:54.161 --> 05:55.893
to trans kids.

05:55.929 --> 05:57.628
- What'd you say?
- Well, a few them started

05:57.664 --> 06:00.030
this a cappella group,
and they're all kind of chubby.

06:00.066 --> 06:04.301
So I said, "You guys should
call yourselves the Trans Fats."

06:04.337 --> 06:07.070
Meg, you'll sit
next to me this evening.

06:07.106 --> 06:10.207
- But, Dad...
- I'm sorry, Chris. You've fallen out of favor.

06:10.243 --> 06:12.080
Perhaps forever.

06:16.816 --> 06:18.650
Oh, Stewie,
thank God you're here.

06:18.686 --> 06:20.784
There's a seagull
in your hallway.

06:20.820 --> 06:21.952
Listen, what are we gonna do

06:21.988 --> 06:23.554
about this
Principal Shepherd thing?

06:23.590 --> 06:26.758
Look, all you know is that
the guy was carrying a wet bag.

06:26.794 --> 06:28.392
It doesn't mean
he killed his wife.

06:28.428 --> 06:30.428
You're building this whole theory...

06:30.464 --> 06:31.662
What is that noise?

06:31.698 --> 06:33.130
It's a news alert.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.501
"Fiona Shepherd, wife of James
Woods High School principal

06:36.537 --> 06:39.169
John Shepherd,
has been reported missing."

06:39.205 --> 06:41.171
Oh, my God, maybe he <i>did</i> do it.

06:41.207 --> 06:43.508
You know, there are
some bad people in this world.

06:43.544 --> 06:45.275
Hey, you don't got
to tell <i>me</i> that.

06:45.311 --> 06:47.344
I learned that in Fight Club.

06:47.380 --> 06:49.914
All right, Stewie, what's
the first rule of Fight Club?

06:49.950 --> 06:51.683
G-string underwear.

06:51.719 --> 06:53.917
No. It's "don't talk
about Fight Club."

06:53.953 --> 06:56.457
Oh. Well, I really blew it.

07:03.029 --> 07:05.363
Hey-o! What's up in this piece?

07:05.399 --> 07:07.097
You're getting home late.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.334
Yeah. We were hanging out
in the woods, and...

07:11.070 --> 07:13.972
...this one girl pushed
another girl over

07:14.008 --> 07:15.839
while she was peeing.

07:15.875 --> 07:17.842
They fought,
and then the cops came.

07:17.878 --> 07:19.142
Meg, this is important.

07:19.178 --> 07:21.178
Did she fall in the pee?

07:21.214 --> 07:22.647
I can smell your breath.

07:22.683 --> 07:24.315
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

07:24.351 --> 07:27.851
No! Geez, Mom, get off my back.

07:27.887 --> 07:30.053
Peter, I think
she's doing booze.

07:30.089 --> 07:31.489
What should we do?

07:31.525 --> 07:33.323
Lois, she's just being
a teenager.

07:33.359 --> 07:35.993
We don't know she's, like, for
sure, definitely been drinking.

07:36.029 --> 07:38.162
I found this in her room.

07:38.198 --> 07:39.864
My little girl's a drunk!

07:39.900 --> 07:43.635
Oh, my God,
where did we go wrong?

07:48.016 --> 07:50.645
Meg, we need to talk.

07:50.681 --> 07:53.002
What, Mom? But I know
what you're gonna say,

07:53.038 --> 07:54.612
and I know how
you're gonna say it.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.142
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

07:56.178 --> 07:57.482
I don't want you drinkin'

07:57.518 --> 07:59.694
or your life's
gonna go down the crappah.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.735
That's not bad.

08:01.771 --> 08:03.720
I-I mean,
I sound nothing like that,

08:03.756 --> 08:05.596
but it's a fun character. Heh.

08:05.632 --> 08:06.826
But this is serious.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.828
Alcoholism runs in our family.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.463
Hey, I'm just glad
<i>something</i> runs in this family.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.600
I don't mean to...

08:14.636 --> 08:17.470
I-I don't mean to laugh, okay?
But that was funny.

08:17.506 --> 08:19.071
Mom, I'm just having fun.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.907
I'm finally known as something
other than "the chubby girl

08:21.943 --> 08:23.609
who put the lunch lady
in a headlock."

08:23.645 --> 08:25.677
And besides, Dad's the one

08:25.713 --> 08:27.446
who pushed me
into going to that party.

08:27.482 --> 08:29.684
Oh, he did, did he?

08:30.886 --> 08:32.451
Son of a bitch.
What was that?

08:32.487 --> 08:35.119
I don't know. Someone
must've messed something up.

08:35.155 --> 08:37.322
Listen, you need to talk to Meg
about her drinking.

08:37.358 --> 08:38.624
What? Why me?

08:38.660 --> 08:39.924
Because you're the one
who told her

08:39.960 --> 08:41.826
to start going
to these parties.

08:41.862 --> 08:43.294
Okay, fine.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.498
I guess it's just something
I got to deal with.

08:45.534 --> 08:47.803
Like the flush
of a high-powered toilet.

08:56.545 --> 08:59.644
So, you plan on going back
at that banana, huh?

08:59.680 --> 09:00.980
So the bastard killed his wife,

09:01.016 --> 09:02.715
and then reported her missing.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.853
I-I got to...
I got to call the cops.

09:07.188 --> 09:09.187
- Quahog Police.
- Joe, Joe, it's Brian.

09:09.223 --> 09:10.788
Listen, I have
to tell you something.

09:10.824 --> 09:12.224
I-I'm pretty sure

09:12.260 --> 09:13.725
Principal Shepherd
killed his wife.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.729
That's a serious accusation.
Do you have any proof?

09:16.765 --> 09:18.797
I have something better
than proof:

09:18.833 --> 09:21.634
rank suspicion born out
of boredom and loneliness.

09:21.670 --> 09:24.168
Sorry, that's just not enough
for us to go on.

09:24.204 --> 09:27.373
You must be pretty tired
from thinking about all this.

09:27.409 --> 09:29.841
- You ever get bags under your eyes?
- What?

09:29.877 --> 09:32.811
I've been using this eye cream,
it's done wonders for me.

09:32.847 --> 09:35.147
It's made by a company
called Rodan and Fields.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.548
Have you heard of them, Brian?

09:36.584 --> 09:37.649
Yeah, I-I think, uh...

09:37.685 --> 09:39.217
Oh, they make terrific stuff.

09:39.253 --> 09:40.818
In fact, I was such a fan,

09:40.854 --> 09:42.754
I became a sales consultant
for the company.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.355
Listen, Joe, I got to run.

09:44.391 --> 09:46.358
I'm hosting a little
get-together tomorrow night,

09:46.394 --> 09:48.594
If you want to stop by.
There's gonna be pizza

09:48.630 --> 09:52.031
and soft drinks, then a man's
gonna talk about the whole line.

09:52.067 --> 09:54.700
Can I go ahead
and confirm your attendance?

09:54.736 --> 09:56.201
Well, that was no help.

09:56.237 --> 09:58.236
What if I go over there
and try to find some evidence

09:58.272 --> 09:59.871
- that he did it?
- All right, fine.

09:59.907 --> 10:00.940
But you have to be careful.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.707
Don't worry,
he won't have any idea.

10:02.743 --> 10:04.009
I'll be more discreet

10:04.045 --> 10:06.748
than a guy standing by himself
in the ocean.

10:08.750 --> 10:09.715
Hey, are you peeing?

10:09.751 --> 10:10.883
No.

10:10.919 --> 10:12.116
Are you pooping?

10:12.152 --> 10:13.952
I'm just trying
to enjoy the day.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.754
Why don't you
go bother that guy?

10:15.790 --> 10:18.560
Summer's blown by, huh?

10:21.596 --> 10:23.595
So, your mom says
you've been drinking.

10:23.631 --> 10:25.196
Yeah, like, a little bit, but...

10:25.232 --> 10:26.864
but it's nothing
you have to worry about.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.801
Look, I-I was young,
too, you know.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.204
I-I remember going to parties,
walking up with a six pack.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.873
You're so excited to get there,
you start jogging a little.

10:34.909 --> 10:37.775
Your friends are all there,
and they're so happy to see you,

10:37.811 --> 10:39.411
they're practically cheering
your name.

10:39.447 --> 10:42.246
And then "Mony Mony" comes on
at just the right time.

10:42.282 --> 10:43.749
And everyone's dancing,

10:43.785 --> 10:46.652
and-and Laura Hallston's jugs
are just slamming into you.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.387
You don't have a care
in the world,

10:48.423 --> 10:51.322
and if all of it came to an end
right then and there, so be it.

10:51.358 --> 10:53.057
Well, you're my daughter,

10:53.093 --> 10:55.893
and I don't want
any of that for you.

10:55.929 --> 10:59.267
Hey, you want to see where I was
sitting when you were born?

11:02.804 --> 11:05.070
Yeah, I still think
about Laura a lot.

11:05.106 --> 11:07.306
You were already drinking
tonight, weren't you?

11:07.342 --> 11:08.773
A little.

11:08.809 --> 11:11.409
Well, I can't talk
to a drunk person if I'm sober.

11:11.445 --> 11:13.745
Hey, Jerome,
can I get a beer, please?

11:13.781 --> 11:15.980
But now <i>I'm</i> starting
to sober up,

11:16.016 --> 11:18.917
so I'm gonna need one
to keep an even playing field.

11:18.953 --> 11:20.952
All right,
but it stays between us.

11:20.988 --> 11:22.488
And what if they card you?

11:22.524 --> 11:24.793
Don't worry. I got it covered.

11:26.995 --> 11:28.760
Wow. That's really good.

11:28.796 --> 11:32.000
Right?! Jerome, make it two!

12:22.883 --> 12:25.417
All right, he's gone.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.853
Now, if I give the word, you've
got to get out of there, okay?

12:27.889 --> 12:29.721
Got it.

12:29.757 --> 12:31.355
Oh, my God!

12:31.391 --> 12:32.758
What? What is it?

12:32.794 --> 12:34.326
He sleeps in a bunk bed!

12:34.362 --> 12:36.061
Are you kidding me?!
Who is this guy?!

12:36.097 --> 12:38.062
Wait a second. Is that...?

12:38.098 --> 12:39.932
Bri, I'm gonna put you down
for a sec.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.271
Stewie, no! Don't.

12:47.909 --> 12:49.340
Stewie, get out of there!

12:49.376 --> 12:51.176
Stewie! Stewie!

12:51.212 --> 12:54.482
Got to get his attention.

12:55.550 --> 12:57.652
Man, just short.

13:00.288 --> 13:02.624
Oh, God.

13:14.803 --> 13:16.768
Domino's.

13:16.804 --> 13:19.470
Oh, good.

13:19.506 --> 13:20.873
Medium pie, ten wings.

13:20.909 --> 13:22.874
Is the blue cheese
dressing in there?

13:22.910 --> 13:24.442
Thanks a lot. Have a good one.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.689
Mmm.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.498
He got out! Ha, ha!
Yes, Stewie!

13:54.843 --> 13:56.274
Oh, crap.

13:56.310 --> 13:57.975
Oh, my, that was close.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.913
Stewie, he saw you! He saw you
leaving his apartment!

14:00.949 --> 14:03.014
Oh. Well... so what?

14:03.050 --> 14:05.153
He doesn't know
what we're doing.

14:08.957 --> 14:10.958
What? What is it?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.991
Well, that's...

14:14.027 --> 14:15.760
that's not good.

14:26.841 --> 14:28.172
Dad? Dad, wake up!

14:28.208 --> 14:29.674
- Huh? What happened?
- I don't know!

14:29.710 --> 14:31.844
We must have stolen this boat
last night.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.881
I-I have no idea
where the hell we are!

14:35.817 --> 14:37.783
Oh, no, my cell phone's dead!

14:37.819 --> 14:39.717
I got a little bit
of juice left,

14:39.753 --> 14:41.720
so we can either
A, call someone,

14:41.756 --> 14:43.522
maybe they answer,
maybe they can help,

14:43.558 --> 14:47.058
or B, we can definitely
switch faces.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.661
Look at you!
Look at me!

14:49.697 --> 14:51.129
That's what this is!

14:51.165 --> 14:53.569
Oh, we're gonna die.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.450
Dad, what are we gonna do?

15:00.486 --> 15:02.752
You think it's too early to tie
our shirts around our heads

15:02.788 --> 15:04.314
to show we're going insane?

15:04.350 --> 15:06.650
I mean it, Dad. This is serious.

15:06.686 --> 15:08.150
I did pants instead.

15:08.186 --> 15:10.817
Ugh! I don't feel so hot.

15:10.853 --> 15:12.293
What is wrong with me?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.337
Have you taken a break
since you started drinking?

15:14.373 --> 15:15.956
Not until right now.

15:15.992 --> 15:17.941
Do you feel like lying
on the couch, rubbing your eyes,

15:17.977 --> 15:20.084
while listening
to Lou Reed's "Perfect Day"?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.289
- Yes!
- Then I'll tell you what's wrong with you.

15:22.325 --> 15:23.413
You got a hangover.

15:23.449 --> 15:25.156
What can you do for a hangover?

15:25.192 --> 15:26.983
Well, Meg,
so I don't have to think

15:27.019 --> 15:28.317
about my throbbing headache,

15:28.353 --> 15:30.653
I try to think of
something else, like a riddle.

15:30.689 --> 15:33.623
Like, how would you describe
Chris O'Donnell?

15:33.659 --> 15:36.926
Huh. He's not tall or short.

15:36.962 --> 15:39.129
And he's not fat or thin.

15:39.165 --> 15:41.831
Well, he's not handsome or ugly.

15:41.867 --> 15:45.335
And he's not young or old.

15:45.371 --> 15:47.369
He's not loud or quiet.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.673
Uh, he's not memorable,
but-but I know who he is.

15:50.709 --> 15:52.709
Thanks, Dad!

15:52.745 --> 15:54.543
I feel so much better.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.145
But you know who doesn't?

15:56.181 --> 15:57.681
Chris O'Donnell.

15:57.717 --> 15:59.251
Bye, dildo.

16:06.092 --> 16:08.057
Oh, no. Hard shoes on linoleum.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.625
That's a principal!

16:09.661 --> 16:11.494
Brian, a lot of people
live in this building,

16:11.530 --> 16:14.230
and you can't tell it's
a principal just from a walk.

16:16.102 --> 16:19.402
Excuse me? May I have
your attention, please?

16:19.438 --> 16:21.574
Okay, that's probably
a principal.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.676
Hey. How are you today?

16:26.712 --> 16:28.211
What can I do for you?

16:28.247 --> 16:29.645
What do you want from me?

16:29.681 --> 16:31.581
Listen, it's...
it's-it's not what you think.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.082
Then what is it?

16:33.118 --> 16:36.219
Well... I'm, um...
I'm actually doing a documentary

16:36.255 --> 16:37.687
about some
of the finest principals

16:37.723 --> 16:39.321
in the country, and...

16:39.357 --> 16:40.923
Ow! Continue.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.226
"Finest principals
in the country" and...

16:44.262 --> 16:46.062
Brian!

16:46.098 --> 16:48.398
Stewie! Help me!

16:48.434 --> 16:50.166
<i>How did I get here?</i>

16:50.202 --> 16:53.269
<i>Well, to answer that, you'd
have to go back a little while.</i>

16:53.305 --> 16:54.437
<i>We're not doing that!</i>

16:58.743 --> 17:00.877
We found this in a Dumpster

17:00.913 --> 17:02.512
behind Principal Shepherd's
building.

17:02.548 --> 17:04.379
That's it.
That's-that's the bag!

17:04.415 --> 17:06.118
I guarantee his wife's in there.

17:09.789 --> 17:11.955
Ha! What's the matter, rook?
Too heavy for you?

17:11.991 --> 17:13.889
I've actually been a cop
for years.

17:13.925 --> 17:15.558
I have tummy cancer.

17:15.594 --> 17:17.764
Oh. Weird way to say that.

17:19.431 --> 17:21.464
What the hell? Bu-But I saw...

17:21.500 --> 17:22.732
Yeah, well, what is all this?

17:22.768 --> 17:24.033
Principal Shepherd,

17:24.069 --> 17:26.468
I think you've got
some explaining to do.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.604
Look, I tried to tell you,
I didn't kill my wife.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.107
She just texted me today
that she's moved out

17:31.143 --> 17:33.243
and she's banging my cousin,

17:33.279 --> 17:35.311
Pat Sajak's accountant,
by the way.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.979
It's a weird time to name drop.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.915
And the food, well,
I've been stealing it

17:38.951 --> 17:40.783
from the high school
to make ends meet.

17:40.819 --> 17:43.253
My life's "kinda brute,"
as the kids say.

17:43.289 --> 17:44.987
Sounds like
you've had a rough day.

17:45.023 --> 17:48.323
No wonder you've got those bags
under your eyes.

17:48.359 --> 17:52.728
Have you ever heard of a company
called Rodan and Fields?

17:54.867 --> 17:58.333
Ugh. Are all hangovers this bad?

17:58.369 --> 18:01.404
Yup, that's the deal
you make with the gods of fun.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.505
Every 72 hours, you lose a day.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.975
Dad, you're so sunburnt.

18:06.011 --> 18:08.410
I can't move
because it hurts too bad.

18:08.446 --> 18:10.013
Ugh. This is awful.

18:10.049 --> 18:12.615
We don't even know
if anyone's looking for us.

18:12.651 --> 18:14.516
Look, don't worry.
We're gonna be okay.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.485
This is why you shouldn't drink.

18:16.521 --> 18:18.754
Booze is nothing but trouble,
and you don't need it.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.790
You got a good brain
in your head.

18:20.826 --> 18:24.159
Thanks, Dad, and if this is what
drinking makes you feel like,

18:24.195 --> 18:25.762
you don't have
to worry about it.

18:25.798 --> 18:27.996
I am done with booze.

18:28.032 --> 18:29.933
Aw, I'm glad to hear that.

18:29.969 --> 18:31.834
And I'm sorry
I pushed it on you.

18:31.870 --> 18:34.169
I just...
I just wanted to watch TV.

18:34.205 --> 18:36.472
I don't want
to see you waste opportunities

18:36.508 --> 18:38.308
'cause you were out partying.

18:38.344 --> 18:39.809
That's what I did.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.811
You just worry about being you.

18:41.847 --> 18:43.312
Don't worry, Dad.

18:43.348 --> 18:45.447
I'll never be anything like you.

18:45.483 --> 18:47.386
That's my girl.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.923
Dad, look!

18:52.724 --> 18:55.328
Oh, my God.
Meg, we're saved!

19:00.566 --> 19:02.631
Thank God you found us.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.700
We're so glad
you picked us up...

19:04.736 --> 19:06.703
- Chris O'Donnell?
- That's right.

19:06.739 --> 19:09.472
And I hope
you like turbulence, dildos.

19:09.508 --> 19:11.373
<i>The actual Chris O'Donnell</i>

19:11.409 --> 19:13.909
<i>is not a Coast Guard
helicopter pilot.</i>

19:13.945 --> 19:15.948
<i>We assume
he's probably too short.</i>

19:20.286 --> 19:22.819
Oh, my God.
Brian, are you okay?

19:22.855 --> 19:24.187
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:24.223 --> 19:25.554
Annie, are you okay?

19:25.590 --> 19:28.190
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

19:28.226 --> 19:29.692
What happened to her?

19:29.728 --> 19:31.026
She was hit by, uh...

19:31.062 --> 19:32.861
She was struck
by a smooth criminal.

19:32.897 --> 19:34.530
That was fun, Mom.

19:34.566 --> 19:37.166
We don't get to do a lot
of that kind of stuff together.

19:37.202 --> 19:40.203
Listen, Brian,
we want you to come home again.

19:40.239 --> 19:43.606
Oh, so the Twitter pariah
is finally welcome home?

19:43.642 --> 19:46.542
No, but the school board
hero dog is.

19:46.578 --> 19:48.378
It was all over the papers.

19:48.414 --> 19:51.848
You saved the school $206
from all the food they recovered

19:51.884 --> 19:53.715
from Principal Shepherd's
fridge.

19:53.751 --> 19:56.418
So... you really want me
to come home?

19:56.454 --> 19:58.521
They're still gonna serve
that food?

19:58.557 --> 20:01.424
Of course we do.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.426
Hey, where's everyone else?

20:03.462 --> 20:05.861
Oh, my God.
Peter, what happened?

20:05.897 --> 20:07.796
<i>What happened? A fair question.</i>

20:07.832 --> 20:10.565
<i>And to answer it,
we have to go back a ways.</i>

20:10.601 --> 20:12.971
- <i>Stop doing that thing!</i>
- Aw.

20:16.292 --> 20:19.160
Brian, I got to say, it's great
to have you home again, buddy.

20:19.196 --> 20:20.661
Well, it's great to be here.

20:20.697 --> 20:21.996
Living on my own was fun,

20:22.032 --> 20:24.099
but I couldn't stop thinking
about all the stuff

20:24.135 --> 20:25.632
I was missing
being away from you guys.

20:25.668 --> 20:27.602
Did you ever finish
that banana, Brian?

20:27.638 --> 20:30.705
And, Meg, I hope you learned
your lesson about drinking.

20:30.741 --> 20:33.775
Yeah, I think I'd rather
live my life as a loser

20:33.811 --> 20:35.843
than feel bad once in a while.

20:35.879 --> 20:38.712
Well, I hope you know
that you're <i>our</i> loser.

20:38.748 --> 20:40.751
Thanks, Mom.

20:47.992 --> 20:50.525
<i>If my life were better here,</i>

20:50.561 --> 20:54.532
<i>would I stop searching
for it... up there?</i>

20:54.568 --> 20:59.568
