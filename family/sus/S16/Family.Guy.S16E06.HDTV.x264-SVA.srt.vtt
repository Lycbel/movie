Thanks for driving me to the
library for story time, Brian.

00:37.377 --> 00:39.511
Today we're reading<i>
The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>

00:39.547 --> 00:41.146
<i>vs. The Human Centipede.</i>

00:41.182 --> 00:42.981
I heard it's like
<i>Alien vs. Predator</i>

00:43.017 --> 00:44.682
with a little bit more
butt eating.

00:44.718 --> 00:47.085
That does sound fun,
but what if I took you

00:47.121 --> 00:49.354
- to a different library today?
- What?

00:49.390 --> 00:52.190
But I like my library.
I met Curious George there.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.125
Mom said he was a puppet,
but she's stupid.

00:54.161 --> 00:56.026
I'm just saying we should
go to the library

00:56.062 --> 00:57.529
at Quahog University

00:57.565 --> 00:59.464
and take your education
to a higher level.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.267
I guess I can try it.
I mean, I do want to get ahead.

01:02.303 --> 01:06.036
I don't want to end up like Meg,
doing sad one-woman shows.

01:22.822 --> 01:24.321
Whose fault is this?

01:24.357 --> 01:26.157
You're wearing a
garbage bag as a cape.

01:26.193 --> 01:27.192
Who do you think?

01:27.228 --> 01:30.231
- Him?
- Shh. She's crushing it!

01:38.271 --> 01:40.637
Oh, yeah.
That's good library.

01:40.673 --> 01:43.907
Aw, you didn't come here for me;
you came to be a creep.

01:43.943 --> 01:45.377
Whatever.
You go do your thing.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.911
I'm gonna go watch that young
hotshot attorney over there

01:47.947 --> 01:50.181
who's clearly in the middle
of a movie montage.

02:01.561 --> 02:04.431
Oh! He found it.
He's gonna win the case.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.434
Oh, no. It was a '70s movie.

02:19.813 --> 02:22.113
- So, who you reading?
- George Eliot.

02:22.149 --> 02:23.514
Ah, Georgie.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.782
I'm a big fan.

02:24.818 --> 02:26.084
- I think he, uh...
- She.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.453
...she said it best
when she said...

02:28.489 --> 02:31.189
"Bantam Press, 1851."

02:32.660 --> 02:34.392
- Lumineers?
- What?

02:34.428 --> 02:37.227
- Hmm?
- You just said "Lumineers" with no context.

02:37.263 --> 02:39.364
Did I do that?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.735
Ugh!

02:41.901 --> 02:43.470
Tumblr?

02:46.073 --> 02:49.874
Wow, I've never seen someone go
oh for six in 15 minutes before.

02:49.910 --> 02:53.411
Just hard rejection
after hard rejection.

02:55.448 --> 02:57.781
- What's going on over there?
- Looks like a student rally.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.650
They probably forgot
to study for an exam,

02:59.686 --> 03:01.318
so they organized
a protest.

03:01.354 --> 03:03.221
In the '90s, you'd
just pull a fire alarm...

03:03.257 --> 03:04.555
now you hold a protest.

03:04.591 --> 03:07.595
That is, when they're not
looking down at their phones.

03:11.198 --> 03:12.896
Hey, what's going on?

03:12.932 --> 03:14.965
Someone wrote "weird" on
the transgender bathroom,

03:15.001 --> 03:16.967
and the school president
didn't overreact,

03:17.003 --> 03:18.502
so we want him fired!

03:18.538 --> 03:19.838
Seems reasonable.

03:19.874 --> 03:20.905
Exactly!

03:20.941 --> 03:22.406
Oh, I see
news cameras.

03:22.442 --> 03:26.911
I'm gonna yell "Viva la Stool"
like a young, white drunkard.

03:26.947 --> 03:29.481
And last week, a professor told
his class to have a nice day,

03:29.517 --> 03:30.582
which is microaggression,

03:30.618 --> 03:32.115
because in our
systemic rape culture

03:32.151 --> 03:33.984
no day is a nice day.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.519
So we want him fired, too.

03:35.555 --> 03:37.689
Hey,
if you don't want to get fired,

03:37.725 --> 03:39.457
- don't become a teacher, right?
- Totally.

03:39.493 --> 03:41.859
You should tweet that.
#FireEveryone.

03:41.895 --> 03:43.293
Viva la Stool!

03:43.329 --> 03:46.197
Well, I guess I could
fire up my account again.

03:46.233 --> 03:47.598
All right, open app.

03:47.634 --> 03:49.366
Got a bunch of those.
No biggie.

03:49.402 --> 03:50.768
Typing tweet.

03:50.804 --> 03:52.269
Blast off in three,

03:52.305 --> 03:53.838
two, one,

03:53.874 --> 03:55.607
and tweeted.

03:55.643 --> 03:58.175
I am back in the game. See?

03:58.211 --> 03:59.777
Oop, you're gone.

03:59.813 --> 04:01.479
And the crowd is gone.

04:01.515 --> 04:03.818
And the animators are gone.

04:07.854 --> 04:10.153
Hey, Stewie, what do you
think about this tweet?

04:10.189 --> 04:11.623
Oh, don't be that guy.

04:11.659 --> 04:13.624
"Kelly Ripa
no-shows at work."

04:13.660 --> 04:16.294
Who does she think she is,
a Republican senator?

04:16.330 --> 04:18.796
#G-O-P-U.

04:18.832 --> 04:21.131
Three references in one
tweet. I'm sweating.

04:21.167 --> 04:23.301
I'll just add it
to my notes for later.

04:23.337 --> 04:24.968
Why are you
getting into Twitter <i>now?</i>

04:25.004 --> 04:27.838
Unless you're an athlete
or a celebrity, no one cares.

04:27.874 --> 04:29.640
A lot of people
like my stuff.

04:29.676 --> 04:32.143
Oh, yeah? Someone needs
to tell Donald Trump

04:32.179 --> 04:33.578
it's not fashionable

04:33.614 --> 04:35.547
to wear orange on your
face after Labor Day.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.215
#OompaTrumpa.

04:37.251 --> 04:39.150
Zero retweets.
Zero likes.

04:39.186 --> 04:40.885
- Yeah, viral.
- You know, I don't care.

04:40.921 --> 04:42.921
You can't stop me.
Just like people

04:42.957 --> 04:45.155
can't stop Peter
from ordering shepherd's pie.

04:45.191 --> 04:46.991
And what can I get
for you, sir?

04:47.027 --> 04:48.225
I'll have the
shepherd's pie.

04:48.261 --> 04:50.160
I'm sorry, but that's
not on the menu.

04:50.196 --> 04:51.828
- Well, do you have potatoes?
- Yes.

04:51.864 --> 04:52.897
- Butter?
- Yes.

04:52.933 --> 04:53.998
- Cream?
- Yes.

04:54.034 --> 04:54.999
- Salt?
- Yes.

04:55.035 --> 04:55.999
- Pepper?
- Yes.

04:56.035 --> 04:57.001
- Garlic?
- Yes.

04:57.037 --> 04:58.068
- Onions?
- Yes.

04:58.104 --> 04:59.169
- Lamb?
- Yes.

04:59.205 --> 05:00.270
- Carrots?
- Yes.

05:00.306 --> 05:01.338
- Eggs?
- Yes.

05:01.374 --> 05:02.407
- Flour?
- Yes.

05:02.443 --> 05:03.508
- Rosemary?
- Yes.

05:03.544 --> 05:04.542
- Thyme?
- Yes.

05:04.578 --> 05:05.609
- Chicken broth?
- Yes.

05:05.645 --> 05:06.677
- Corn?
- Yes.

05:06.713 --> 05:07.744
- Peas?
- Yes.

05:07.780 --> 05:10.013
Lightsaber?

05:10.049 --> 05:12.987
Remember when we did <i>Star Wars?</i>

05:17.825 --> 05:21.792
Better get a tweet out before
I go dark for a few hours.

05:23.129 --> 05:25.629
About to see
the new Kevin Hart movie.

05:25.665 --> 05:28.433
Just kidding.
I'm white and went to college.

05:28.469 --> 05:30.738
#BaywatchMovie.

06:30.073 --> 06:31.634
Wow, I haven't seen
that much camel toe

06:31.670 --> 06:33.406
since the Arab Spring.

06:33.442 --> 06:36.177
#ThinkingInTweets.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.493
Nah.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.197
Hey, are you @dogbackwards
from Twitter?

06:42.233 --> 06:44.063
I am. Are-are you a fan?

06:44.099 --> 06:45.518
You racist jerk!

06:45.554 --> 06:48.154
I hope you get
foot-and-mouth disease!

06:48.190 --> 06:50.092
What the hell was that?

06:50.128 --> 06:52.338
Uh-oh.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.824
<i>Wow, you are blowing up!</i>

06:58.860 --> 07:00.393
<i>Blowing up</i> bad.

07:00.429 --> 07:02.894
<i>Ah, look at that...</i> Huffington
Post <i>just picked it up.</i>

07:02.930 --> 07:04.095
<i>Buckle up, buddy.</i>

07:08.737 --> 07:10.873
- There he is!
- Where? I'm in the back.

07:19.847 --> 07:22.814
Hey, how was <i>Baywatch?</i>
I want to see that bad.

07:22.850 --> 07:24.516
What were you thinking,
writing that tweet?

07:24.552 --> 07:26.018
What? It was just a joke.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.821
Brian, it's not 2005...
you can't just go online

07:28.857 --> 07:30.422
and say whatever
you want.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.825
Yeah, remember how mad
people got when DiGiorno tweeted

07:32.861 --> 07:34.393
about domestic violence?

07:34.429 --> 07:36.595
And they're not even a guy.
They're pizza.

07:36.631 --> 07:38.564
All right, all right,
I'll delete the tweet.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.265
You haven't
deleted it yet?

07:40.301 --> 07:42.371
What a train wreck!

07:44.705 --> 07:45.705
There. Done. Done.

07:45.741 --> 07:47.172
See? It's done. It's gone.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.174
What about all those
people outside?

07:49.210 --> 07:50.609
They'll see that I deleted it,

07:50.645 --> 07:52.044
and it'll all blow over.
Trust me.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.746
I hope so, but
you never know.

07:53.782 --> 07:57.183
They're still pretty mad at me
down at Dick's Sporting Goods.

07:57.219 --> 07:58.951
Um, what's the name
of this place?

07:58.987 --> 08:00.352
Dick's.

08:00.388 --> 08:02.688
A-And what's that say
on your shirt?

08:02.724 --> 08:04.556
Dick's.

08:04.592 --> 08:07.193
Can I have two balls...
and a helmet?

08:07.229 --> 08:09.261
Hey, you're the guy
from the phone.

08:10.398 --> 08:11.864
Start the car, Chris!

08:11.900 --> 08:14.470
- Did you get him, Dad?
- We got him!

08:18.507 --> 08:20.472
Hey, Sid.
Happy Mango Monday.

08:20.508 --> 08:21.774
Hmm.

08:21.810 --> 08:24.276
Hmm. Those nighttime
information technology classes

08:24.312 --> 08:26.444
must really be getting to Sid.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.545
Hey, Curt.

08:27.581 --> 08:28.546
Hmm.

08:28.582 --> 08:30.382
Curt? Come on, it's me,

08:30.418 --> 08:32.217
Lunchtime Lois.

08:32.253 --> 08:33.752
Gil, help me out here.

08:33.788 --> 08:35.054
Hmm!

08:35.090 --> 08:37.823
Gil, no! Uh, what about Barbara?
Is she back there?

08:37.859 --> 08:39.324
She can clear this up.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.825
Let me talk to Barbara.

08:40.861 --> 08:42.794
She doesn't want
to talk to you, either.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.063
Nobody does...

08:44.099 --> 08:46.064
not as long as you're
living with that racist dog.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.232
Oh, come on!

08:47.268 --> 08:48.900
It was just a bad joke.

08:48.936 --> 08:50.136
Where's Stanley?

08:50.172 --> 08:52.338
He'll vouch for me.
Let me talk to Stanley.

08:52.374 --> 08:55.073
Or Henry. Somebody
help me out here.

08:55.109 --> 08:56.741
- Chip?
- Hmm!

08:56.777 --> 08:58.343
- Karen?
- Hmm!

08:58.379 --> 08:59.844
- JJ?
- Hmm.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.514
- Angela?
- Hmm.

09:01.550 --> 09:02.747
- Tito?
- Hmm!

09:02.783 --> 09:04.583
- Larry?
- Hmm!

09:04.619 --> 09:06.485
You can't freeze me out
like this.

09:06.521 --> 09:08.453
We're on a first-name basis!

09:08.489 --> 09:10.456
They're on our
name tags, Lois.

09:10.492 --> 09:13.092
But I don't even have to look!

09:13.128 --> 09:16.398
I don't even have to look!

09:21.470 --> 09:24.669
Hey, how come no one told me
we were going to the Clam?

09:24.705 --> 09:26.137
Hey, Jerome,
give me a beer.

09:26.173 --> 09:28.341
Oh, why? 'Cause I'm,
like, your slave?

09:28.377 --> 09:31.177
Man, you're no better
than your racist dog.

09:31.213 --> 09:32.178
Come on, man.

09:32.214 --> 09:34.112
B-Brian was
just making a joke.

09:34.148 --> 09:36.482
I told you about Brian.
I told you.

09:36.518 --> 09:38.483
Come on, he deleted
his tweet.

09:38.519 --> 09:41.286
But the hurt has been RT'd
in our hearts.

09:41.322 --> 09:42.954
Peter, you better
get out of here

09:42.990 --> 09:45.290
before I start
saying "sir" like a cop.

09:45.326 --> 09:46.891
- Come on, Joe, I...
- Sir? Sir?

09:46.927 --> 09:48.394
You've been asked
to leave.

09:48.430 --> 09:50.129
- Joe, it's me, Peter. I...
- Sir.

09:50.165 --> 09:52.298
I don't want to have
to ask you again.

09:52.334 --> 09:54.132
- Please leave.
- All right, fine.

09:54.168 --> 09:55.400
- Sir!
- No, Joe, Joe.

09:55.436 --> 09:56.468
- He's leaving.
- Sir!

09:56.504 --> 09:57.569
- Joe, Joe...
- Sir!

09:57.605 --> 09:58.636
- He's gone.
- Sir.

09:58.672 --> 10:00.206
- It's okay.
- Sir.

10:00.242 --> 10:02.044
He's gone.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.983
Your dog wrote an
insensitive tweet.

10:12.019 --> 10:13.519
You can't eat here.

10:13.555 --> 10:15.688
Uh-oh, Meg.
It's a sensitivity mob.

10:15.724 --> 10:17.256
It was just a joke.

10:17.292 --> 10:19.357
There's no such thing
as jokes anymore.

10:19.393 --> 10:21.427
Yeah, we live in
a post-joke world.

10:21.463 --> 10:23.496
Chris, maybe we
should just eat outside.

10:23.532 --> 10:25.731
No, Meg,
we're eating here.

10:25.767 --> 10:28.070
I'd like to
see you try.

11:50.784 --> 11:55.290
It was... a joke.

12:01.296 --> 12:04.630
Can you put on
the Canucks game?

12:04.666 --> 12:05.964
No, go away.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.166
Loser.

12:08.202 --> 12:09.868
This is getting
out of control.

12:09.904 --> 12:11.770
We can't leave the house
without getting harassed.

12:11.806 --> 12:13.838
Yeah, yesterday I went outside
to try to get the mail

12:13.874 --> 12:15.107
and I had a seizure.

12:15.143 --> 12:17.108
That may not be
protester-related,

12:17.144 --> 12:19.444
but still, you got to
do something, Brian.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.779
What do you want me to do?

12:20.815 --> 12:22.548
I-I deleted my Twitter
account, my Instagram,

12:22.584 --> 12:23.716
Facebook, everything.

12:23.752 --> 12:25.617
People still won't
leave me alone.

12:25.653 --> 12:27.218
You have to apologize.

12:27.254 --> 12:28.953
Go outside, do it now.

12:28.989 --> 12:31.789
Tell them that it was a
mistake and how sorry you are

12:31.825 --> 12:33.158
and maybe they'll
get off our backs.

12:33.194 --> 12:34.827
Maybe you're right.

12:34.863 --> 12:37.129
I got to face them and
hope they'll forgive me.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.300
Hello.

12:42.336 --> 12:45.136
As you all know,
I'm Brian Griffin.

12:45.172 --> 12:46.472
Boo.

12:46.508 --> 12:49.040
Boo, Brian
Griffin. Boo.

12:49.076 --> 12:50.409
I want to read a few words...

12:50.445 --> 12:51.843
Boo. Liar.

12:51.879 --> 12:54.914
Boo, Brian Griffin, boo.

12:54.950 --> 12:56.180
Anyway, I-I want to...

12:56.216 --> 12:58.049
Boo.
Apologize somewhere else.

12:58.085 --> 13:01.987
Boo. Boo, Brian, boo.

13:02.023 --> 13:04.823
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here today to apologize...

13:04.859 --> 13:06.559
Why did you say
"ladies" first?

13:06.595 --> 13:07.892
That's sexist.

13:07.928 --> 13:09.761
It's just, it's just
a-a standard greeting.

13:09.797 --> 13:12.497
Let-let me start over.
Gentlemen and ladies...

13:12.533 --> 13:14.198
Ooh, says the man.

13:14.234 --> 13:17.269
Okay, sorry, I-I...
Um, humans in the audience...

13:17.305 --> 13:19.170
I identify as a basketball.

13:19.206 --> 13:20.872
Humans and basketballs...

13:20.908 --> 13:22.107
I'm a parrot
who mimics words

13:22.143 --> 13:23.442
but doesn't
comprehend them.

13:23.478 --> 13:25.843
Humans, basketballs,
talking parrots,

13:25.879 --> 13:27.846
and-and whatever else
is out there...

13:27.882 --> 13:29.781
"Whatever"? It's whoever.

13:29.817 --> 13:31.416
Actually, it's whomever.

13:31.452 --> 13:33.217
No one likes you, Mary.

13:33.253 --> 13:35.788
All right, all right, just-just calm down, okay?

13:35.824 --> 13:37.722
Now you're
tone policing us!

13:37.758 --> 13:39.024
That makes me
uncomfortable.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.860
Anything that makes me
uncomfortable in 2017

13:41.896 --> 13:43.028
should be illegal.

13:43.064 --> 13:45.863
You know what? (bleep) you.

13:45.899 --> 13:48.199
I'm not a racist, all right?
I just told a bad joke.

13:48.235 --> 13:49.901
There's a huge difference.

13:49.937 --> 13:51.370
But nobody on the Internet
ever takes the time

13:51.406 --> 13:53.738
to ask themselves, "Is this
worth freaking out over?"

13:53.774 --> 13:56.775
Or, "Are there bigger problems
in the world than this tweet?"

13:56.811 --> 13:58.242
Well, I assure you, there are.

13:58.278 --> 14:00.713
And just for the record,
I love black people.

14:00.749 --> 14:02.448
I watch tons of black porn.

14:02.484 --> 14:04.315
So, what do you all
want from me, huh?

14:04.351 --> 14:05.450
You-you want to ruin my life?

14:05.486 --> 14:07.151
Then congratulations.
You did it.

14:07.187 --> 14:08.721
Everybody hates me.

14:08.757 --> 14:10.456
I can't leave the house
without getting harassed.

14:10.492 --> 14:11.723
No one will hire me.

14:11.759 --> 14:13.058
That was a problem before.

14:13.094 --> 14:15.327
I can't turn on my phone
without strangers telling me

14:15.363 --> 14:17.463
to kill myself or that
they're gonna kill my family.

14:17.499 --> 14:18.896
Leave me alone!

14:18.932 --> 14:21.733
I'm the self-righteous,
liberal douchebag, not you!

14:21.769 --> 14:23.836
I've kissed a
transsexual before!

14:23.872 --> 14:25.069
How many of you
can say that?!

14:25.105 --> 14:26.304
Where's my (bleep) medal?!

14:26.340 --> 14:27.805
I am so far left,

14:27.841 --> 14:30.108
I'm spinning in
circles, you (bleep).

14:30.144 --> 14:32.778
Instead of killing myself,
I should kill all of you!

14:32.814 --> 14:34.512
I'd like to see you try.

14:44.825 --> 14:48.193
Ow! Jeez.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.432
Well, we started
the dialogue.

14:53.468 --> 14:55.967
You screamed "black porn"
at the top of your lungs

14:56.003 --> 14:57.535
in front
of women and children.

14:57.571 --> 15:00.105
I am not the person
those people out there say I am.

15:00.141 --> 15:02.373
I know that, but you
also haven't done much

15:02.409 --> 15:03.608
to prove that you aren't.

15:03.644 --> 15:05.343
I know, I know.

15:05.379 --> 15:07.713
All I have left is you guys.

15:07.749 --> 15:08.847
Thank God you have my back.

15:08.883 --> 15:10.949
- We think you should move out.
- What?!

15:10.985 --> 15:13.852
Oh! Brian, listen, we love you,

15:13.888 --> 15:15.887
but they're throwing
things at our house.

15:15.923 --> 15:17.922
We've got to keep
our family safe.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.559
I'm sorry.
It's for the best.

15:20.595 --> 15:22.627
Are you serious?!
You're okay with this?!

15:22.663 --> 15:25.097
Does this slow pan
across our disapproving faces

15:25.133 --> 15:26.402
answer your question?

15:36.977 --> 15:38.310
I saw <i>Baywatch.</i>

15:38.346 --> 15:39.847
That thing was frickin' rad.

15:45.334 --> 15:47.312
I still think this
is a drastic measure.

15:47.348 --> 15:48.646
Yeah, I messed up,

15:48.682 --> 15:50.339
but what about all the stupid
things Peter's done?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.483
He's never been kicked out
and his life...

15:52.519 --> 15:53.751
My life is not the issue here.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.112
Peter, calm down.

15:55.148 --> 15:56.447
Did you eat breakfast
this morning?

15:56.483 --> 15:58.082
I had a banana and a coffee.

15:58.118 --> 16:00.083
Why am I so fat?

16:00.119 --> 16:03.087
I'm sorry, Brian, but this
is the way it has to be.

16:03.123 --> 16:05.121
All right, then.

16:05.157 --> 16:06.793
I guess this is good-bye.

16:14.968 --> 16:16.533
Brian, wait.

16:16.569 --> 16:19.435
This collar is ours.

16:19.471 --> 16:20.670
It has our address on it.

16:20.706 --> 16:23.009
Peace, dude.

16:30.517 --> 16:34.050
All right, radio, time for you
to tell me what this all means.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.740
Hey. Are you here for
the <i>Time</i> magazines

17:30.776 --> 17:32.109
with some of the
letters cut out?

17:32.145 --> 17:35.179
Uh, no, I... no, I saw that you
have an apartment for rent.

17:35.215 --> 17:36.513
Okay.

17:36.549 --> 17:38.415
Here. Apartment 23.

17:38.451 --> 17:39.783
Oh, okay.

17:39.819 --> 17:43.086
I just have one rule here:
no kissing the mailman.

17:43.122 --> 17:44.787
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

17:44.823 --> 17:47.291
You haven't seen him,
so don't say that yet.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.558
Mail's here.

17:48.594 --> 17:50.730
Wow.

18:40.312 --> 18:41.911
If I have
other items I want to buy,

18:41.947 --> 18:44.081
uh, can I buy them here
at the pharmacy window?

18:44.117 --> 18:45.248
Yes.

18:45.284 --> 18:47.417
Ruth?
Yeah, bring it over here.

18:47.453 --> 18:48.785
We can buy them over here.

18:48.821 --> 18:50.086
Where are you?

18:50.122 --> 18:51.154
By the pharmacy.

18:51.190 --> 18:54.490
Hang on,
I'm picking out sunscreen.

18:54.526 --> 18:55.958
Sir, do you mind
if I go ahead of you?

18:55.994 --> 18:58.195
Uh, yes, I do mind.

19:17.750 --> 19:21.951
<i>♪ Somehow I'm neither
here nor there... ♪</i>

19:23.990 --> 19:25.855
Six dollars?

19:28.093 --> 19:30.627
Hey, did you knock over a
few bottles in aisle seven?

19:30.663 --> 19:32.362
Uh, yeah.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.632
Okay.

19:43.009 --> 19:44.740
Patricia?

19:44.776 --> 19:46.677
Where's the big nail clipper?

19:46.713 --> 19:47.744
I don't know.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.045
Did you get rid of it?

19:49.081 --> 19:50.214
Why would I get rid
of the big nail clipper?

19:51.951 --> 19:54.083
'Cause you're a bitch, that's why.

19:54.119 --> 19:56.253
Nice. Yeah, now I'm
gonna tell you where it is.

19:56.289 --> 19:58.354
I knew you knew
where it was, you liar.

19:58.390 --> 19:59.523
Tell me where it is!

19:59.559 --> 20:01.024
No. Find it yourself.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.558
Oh, okay. Fine.

20:02.594 --> 20:04.695
How about I hide
something of yours?! Huh?!

20:04.731 --> 20:06.095
Put that back!

20:06.131 --> 20:09.035
No, tell me where
the big nail clipper is!

20:17.877 --> 20:19.508
Boom.

20:19.544 --> 20:21.711
Damn it.

20:21.747 --> 20:24.081
Why can't
you use the little nail clipper?

20:24.117 --> 20:25.716
I want the big one, okay?!

20:25.752 --> 20:27.750
And I don't want you
using it anymore!

20:27.786 --> 20:29.186
Shut up, little man!

20:29.222 --> 20:30.187
You shut up!

20:30.223 --> 20:33.422
