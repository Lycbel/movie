TV ANNOUNCER:
It's that time of year again.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.137
Are you a New England dirtbag
who wants to run with bulls,

00:38.139 --> 00:40.506
but thinks Spain is gay?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.641
Then don't miss
the Seriously Wicked Bull Run

00:42.643 --> 00:44.510
in South Attleboro, Mass!

00:44.512 --> 00:47.012
You and your friends can run
from a bunch of live bulls,

00:47.014 --> 00:49.848
and lots of times, there's
a chick whose boob comes out!

00:49.850 --> 00:51.750
Order your tickets
before it's too late!

00:52.653 --> 00:54.653
(bull bellows)

00:54.655 --> 00:55.988
Toilets limited.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.556
Wow, that seems
pretty cool.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.857
(groans)
I don't know.

00:58.859 --> 00:59.992
Seems pretty lame to me.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.060
Yeah, waste of time.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.194
I agree.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.529
Hey, Joe,
isn't this your round?

01:03.531 --> 01:05.064
Sure, I'll wheel
over to the bar

01:05.066 --> 01:07.833
and bring back your beers
one-by-one in my lap.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.169
You guys, we are
so doing that bull run!

01:10.171 --> 01:11.670
Buying the tickets as we speak!

01:11.672 --> 01:13.005
But we can't tell Joe.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.673
Of course not,
he'll be dead weight.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.742
You can't do a bull run
with a guy in a wheelchair.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.244
Yeah, this is for athletes.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.885
Just the regular wash, please.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.922
And, uh, I'm supposed to mention
that I saw you on LivingSocial?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.090
Was that worth it?

01:31.092 --> 01:33.192
Was that worth the
one dollar you saved?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.594
I'm sorry, we're not doing
that promotion anymore.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.695
Oh-ho!

01:36.697 --> 01:40.099
All the humiliation,
none of the reward.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.538
You know, some people are okay
with the drive-through car wash.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.907
Me, I'm a fan of the hand job.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.075
Hi, I'm Brian.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.743
Yes, I like to have fun
with language.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.745
(laughs)
You're so funny.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.047
I'm Tori.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.415
I got hit by a car
in high school,

01:56.417 --> 01:57.783
so I don't have to work.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.085
Cool. Hey, so what's
your afternoon like?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.386
I don't have plans.

02:01.388 --> 02:04.123
Maybe we could grab lunch
and then see what happens.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.291
(groans)
This will not end well.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.293
Like eating an artichoke.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.595
Good Lord!

02:09.597 --> 02:12.831
I ate nothing and I'm
soaking wet for some reason.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.437
So, you guys all pumped
to run with the bulls?

02:18.439 --> 02:20.439
You bet, this is gonna be
my first exercise

02:20.441 --> 02:22.441
since I chased that balloon.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.642
Hey, what's going on?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.810
Hey, Joe.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.945
We are competing...

02:26.947 --> 02:30.482
in the international Chef
Boyardee look-alike contest.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.484
Oh, well,
where's your chef hat?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.919
You guys are gonna lose.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.320
Especially Cleveland.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.788
He's in the Cream of Wheat
competition,

02:36.790 --> 02:38.257
which is down the street.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.825
We-we got to go now.
We're very late.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.161
Well, this is funny, because...

02:42.163 --> 02:43.829
guess where I'm going.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.297
And I got the hat.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.665
You guys are dead!

02:46.667 --> 02:48.667
(sighs)
Look, Joe.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.602
We didn't want to tell
you, but we're going

02:50.604 --> 02:52.271
to the Seriously
Wicked Bull Run.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.140
We didn't invite you because we
didn't think you could keep up.

02:55.142 --> 02:58.010
Yeah, we thought it seemed
too dangerous for, uh,

02:58.012 --> 03:01.647
incapacitated, half-man,
shrivel-legged gimps.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.515
And we didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.951
Come on, my handicap
has never held me back.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.486
I'm coming with you guys.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.955
Joe, you peed in your bag
while you said that.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.157
Can you honestly say
that you didn't pee

03:12.159 --> 03:14.993
just now while you
were talking?

03:14.995 --> 03:17.229
Okay, you can come.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.969
Wow, that was amazing.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.137
Hey, uh, uh,
just to be clear,

03:25.139 --> 03:26.705
I don't really
think you're a whore.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.841
I-I just need to say that
to, you know, to finish.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.843
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, of course.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.046
And obviously, I don't think
you're my Uncle Dale.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.314
Good, good, same page.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.481
(car engine humming outside)

03:36.483 --> 03:38.350
Oh, crap,
my husband's home early.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.651
Wait a minute,
you're married?!

03:39.653 --> 03:40.819
And he's here?
Now?!

03:40.821 --> 03:41.887
(car door closes)

03:41.889 --> 03:42.988
Yeah, that's him.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.323
You've got to get out of here.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.691
He's really jealous.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.392
I think he's bitter
because he never got

03:47.394 --> 03:50.229
the credit he deserved
for killing Osama bin Laden.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.097
Your husband's a Navy SEAL?!

03:54.201 --> 03:55.567
What the hell
is going on here?!

03:55.569 --> 03:56.969
What is this?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.405
Ruff!

04:00.407 --> 04:02.407
You got a dog?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.842
Uh... yeah!

04:03.844 --> 04:06.078
I rescued him
from the pound.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.879
(barking)

04:07.881 --> 04:09.681
Well, hey there, buddy.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.416
Wow, his nose is super wet!

04:11.418 --> 04:12.918
He must be healthy.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.854
Uh, and somebody's been
rooting in a sardine can.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.923
Well, I'm gonna
grab a shower.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.025
Great, honey.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.927
Oh. Oh, my God,
that was close.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.895
Yeah, but think about it.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.897
As long as he thinks
you're our new pet,

04:25.899 --> 04:28.100
we can keep fooling
around behind his back.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.235
Huh, you're right.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.937
Wow, this could be
an even better scam

04:31.939 --> 04:34.506
than that claw machine
at the arcade.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.376
Damn it, this game is so stupid!

04:37.378 --> 04:40.746
It's impossible to do anything
with a dumb, crappy claw!

04:40.748 --> 04:43.081
Hey, that's mean,
and it's not even true!

04:43.083 --> 04:44.916
I'm leaving!

04:44.918 --> 04:46.985
Dang it!

04:50.891 --> 04:52.090
You need a little help?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.159
No!

04:56.230 --> 04:59.164
If you could angle up the ring,
then I could kind of hook it.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.736
How do you drive?

05:04.738 --> 05:06.471
Bad!

05:06.473 --> 05:08.540
(crowd clamoring)

05:10.811 --> 05:13.011
(snorting, bellows)

05:17.484 --> 05:19.284
We clearly overdressed.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.320
They have the type
of fat white woman here

05:21.322 --> 05:23.989
that not even
I am interested in.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.157
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies, gentlemen,

05:25.159 --> 05:26.992
and alternative high school
graduates,

05:26.994 --> 05:29.294
get ready to run for your lives!

05:29.296 --> 05:30.495
(beeping)

05:30.497 --> 05:33.465
(air horn blares)

05:33.467 --> 05:34.866
(crowd clamoring)

05:36.970 --> 05:39.171
Aah! I shouldn't
have worn high heels!

05:39.173 --> 05:40.639
Oh, stop it!
You look great.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.575
Oh, well, I didn't want
all<i> this</i> attention.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.178
CLEVELAND:
<i>Cleveland, why do you let them</i>

05:46.180 --> 05:47.779
<i>talk you into these things?</i>

05:47.781 --> 05:50.349
<i>This is how</i>
<i>people pleasers die!</i>

05:50.351 --> 05:52.184
Hey, guys, after this,
let's beat alligators

05:52.186 --> 05:53.352
with sticks or something.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.786
You read my mind!

05:54.788 --> 05:57.055
<i>We just talked about this!</i>

05:58.625 --> 06:00.459
(whoops)
This is amazing!

06:00.461 --> 06:02.594
I told you guys I could do it!

06:21.048 --> 06:24.716
Look... out...

06:24.718 --> 06:28.120
Joe...!

06:36.497 --> 06:37.963
(wheels screeching)

06:40.667 --> 06:42.734
(distorted screaming)

06:59.686 --> 07:01.653
(grunting)

07:02.689 --> 07:05.123
(screaming)

07:07.728 --> 07:09.895
Joe, oh, my God!

07:09.897 --> 07:11.363
You all right?!

07:11.365 --> 07:13.865
I can't feel anything
below my neck!

07:13.867 --> 07:16.101
I can't move a muscle, guys!

07:16.103 --> 07:17.269
Oh, my God!

07:17.271 --> 07:19.771
Joe's completely
paralyzed!

07:19.773 --> 07:21.606
("Walk Like a Man"
by the Four Seasons playing)

07:21.608 --> 07:22.707
Oop, that's me.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.942
That's unfortunate.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.377
That's Lois, hold on.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.578
Hey, babe.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.612
Uh, good.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.947
Little hiccup, but fun.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.725
You guys!

07:40.727 --> 07:43.094
I've been trying to keep
my birthday a secret.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.464
No, Dr. Hartman, we're not
here for your birthday.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.631
We're here for Joe.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.799
Don't sugarcoat it, Doc.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.301
Just give it to me straight.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.570
Well, Mr. Swanson, I did
an exploratory procedure,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.738
which revealed extensive damage.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.808
Please, just tell me--
am I completely paralyzed?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.943
I'm afraid...

07:57.945 --> 07:59.444
of ghosts.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.645
And yes.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.947
Mr. Swanson has
lost all movement,

08:01.949 --> 08:03.982
and will require
around-the-clock care.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.817
Most of it disgusting.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.320
Oh, my God, Bonnie,
I'm so sorry.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.955
If there's anything
I can do...

08:09.957 --> 08:11.323
There actually is.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.458
Could you collect
my mail forever?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.594
I'm leaving Joe
and moving to Europe.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.662
I didn't sign up for this.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.798
Bonnie, wait!
God, this is awful.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.666
What am I gonna do?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.835
Well, seems like you folks
have this all taken care of.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.836
(door opens)

08:24.838 --> 08:25.837
PEOPLE:
Surprise!

08:25.839 --> 08:28.106
HARTMAN:
Oh, you guys!

08:28.108 --> 08:29.608
Hey, don't go in
that room back there.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.843
It's, like,
super sad.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.818
Coming up, quintuplets
born at Quahog General.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.686
What?
That's...

08:41.688 --> 08:43.288
Oh, that's supposed
to be "burn"?

08:43.290 --> 08:47.259
Oh, coming up, quintuplets
burn at Quahog General.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.029
Hey, honey, get in here.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.365
Check this out--
the way he's sitting,

08:53.367 --> 08:55.634
it looks like the dog's
watching the news.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.303
You like watching the
news, you dumb dog?

08:58.305 --> 09:01.206
Well, I'm off to do what
former Navy SEALs do--

09:01.208 --> 09:03.808
sell lawn mowers.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.810
Wow, he really
has no idea.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.046
Hey, want to take
a shower with me?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.714
Sure.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.316
Man, this is a pretty sweet gig.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.652
Like being a member
of Daft Punk.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.820
(French accent):
Look at this old Casio keyboard

09:15.822 --> 09:18.056
from the 1980s
that I have found.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.659
Watch what happens
when I push this demo button.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.062
♪ ♪

09:24.064 --> 09:25.664
Hello, Daft Punk?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.732
Great song.
Here's a Grammy.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.200
Oh-ho-ho!

09:29.202 --> 09:30.402
(French accent):
You know, is funny.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.438
Until you spoke, I did
not know we were French!

09:36.910 --> 09:39.210
There you go, Joe.
All settled.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.079
Now, which wall
would you like to look at

09:41.081 --> 09:42.213
for the rest of your life?

09:42.215 --> 09:44.516
I don't know,
maybe that one.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.585
I-I have no idea
what you're pointing at, Joe.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.886
You got to meet us halfway.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.854
Look, guys, I don't want
to be a burden to anyone.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.756
You go ahead
and live your lives.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.224
I'll be fine.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.859
We can't just
leave you, Joe.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.696
So before we go, I'm gonna
put the remote in your mouth.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.764
Here's a can of chili.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.934
And the opener we'll put...
in your mouth.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.936
And here's a magazine I thought
you might like to read.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.571
I'm gonna put it
in your mouth.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.872
(grunts)

10:07.874 --> 10:09.874
(muffled):
You're a good friend, Peter.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.710
Joe, I just wish
we could do more,

10:11.712 --> 10:14.212
but obviously your
mouth is full.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.081
And you probably don't want
any reminders of Bonnie

10:16.083 --> 10:18.617
around the house, so I cleared
out all of her underwear.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.418
Okay, don't be a stranger.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.621
Yeah, 'cause we're not
supposed to talk to those.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.890
I don't know, I'm not sure
I feel right about leaving Joe.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.960
Doesn't seem like he's gonna be
able to take care of himself.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.962
Yeah, we're-we're kind
of all he has now.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.063
What-- Joe?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.131
What're you talking about?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.567
He's fine.

10:35.569 --> 10:38.136
Look, he's already watching
<i>The Price Is Right</i> in there.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.572
Oop, he's biting
too hard on the volume.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.641
<i>(The Price Is Right</i>
theme song playing)

10:45.412 --> 10:47.245
Okay, you can play over there
in the sandbox, honey.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.481
Mommy's just gonna
read her book.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.416
Okay, I'm just gonna
walk 30 feet away,

10:51.418 --> 10:53.952
and then panic
because I can't see you.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.920
Can you fit me in
at 10:00 tomorrow?

10:55.922 --> 10:57.656
It's getting a little
long on the sides.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.791
Brian? What are you
doing on a leash?

10:59.793 --> 11:01.159
And who's that?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.327
(shushes)
Be cool.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.762
This is the guy whose
wife I'm banging.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.497
Oh, what a romantic way
to put it.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.631
Yeah, it's great.

11:06.633 --> 11:07.999
I just pretend
to be their dog,

11:08.001 --> 11:09.668
and then when he leaves
for work,

11:09.670 --> 11:13.171
I get to go to the<i> pound,</i>
if you know what I mean.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.806
God, Brian,
you are such a scumbag.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.174
I can't believe you--

11:16.176 --> 11:18.276
Mommy! Mommy!
Where's my mommy?!

11:18.278 --> 11:20.011
I have no one and nothing!

11:20.013 --> 11:21.513
LOIS:
I'm right here, honey.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.847
Oh, thank God.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.684
She's such a gross hog.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.356
Joe, you can't
just sit here.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.124
You need intellectual
stimulation.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.126
So I brought something
to read to you.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.029
It's the word search
from the<i> Sunday Circular.</i>

11:38.031 --> 11:39.531
"Kangaroo."

11:39.533 --> 11:41.966
Let's see if we
can find that one.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.201
"Outback."

11:43.203 --> 11:45.136
I think it's an
Australian theme.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.371
"Koala."

11:46.373 --> 11:47.972
It definitely is.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.507
Can't make out this one.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.710
"Abor... Aborgine...

11:51.712 --> 11:53.211
Aborgina"?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.346
That's what they call
eggplant down there.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.981
You know what?
Forget this.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.150
I'll just read
to you from<i> Jet.</i>

11:59.152 --> 12:01.386
Look, this whole page is
all the Wayans brothers

12:01.388 --> 12:03.388
sitting in different
positions.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.990
How you suppose they come up
with all them positions?

12:05.992 --> 12:07.559
You could give me
a million years.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.561
I just ain't
wired that way.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.862
Marlon's like
a rubber man.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.497
He can sit in
any kind of way.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.233
Here's Keenan telling the
younger ones how to sit.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.568
(scoffs) Like they
gonna listen.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.069
Damon's doing
his own thing.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.237
No surprise there.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.505
That's Damon.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.006
You enjoying
all this, Joe?

12:22.008 --> 12:23.842
I'm honestly
just glad it seems

12:23.844 --> 12:25.977
like you have
something you like.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.517
Hey, my laptop's
out of battery.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.885
You want to have sex?

12:33.887 --> 12:36.821
Sure, I've almost finished
my sandwich, anyway.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.025
Oh, come on, I don't want
to have to watch this.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.594
VIC:
Yeah, that's right.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.864
I was the only one
who didn't get to meet Biden.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.098
(groans)
You know what?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.467
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.106
Ha! Skewered.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.775
VIC:
Hey!

12:56.777 --> 12:57.942
Where do you think you're going?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.077
You're my dog.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.879
You're not going anywhere.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.113
Besides, I need you, boy.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.915
Now more than ever.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.451
I think my wife
is cheating on me.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.220
Hey, Tori, it's Brian.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.889
I'm getting
the Chinese food for us.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.424
I think I'm gonna order
some Me Like Bang Ho.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.794
(laughs)
That's-that's not a real thing,

13:15.796 --> 13:17.262
I'm talking about sex.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.397
All right,
I'll be there in five.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.399
Man, when I find
that son of a bitch,

13:21.401 --> 13:23.701
I'm gonna rip
his head off.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.805
God, what a nightmare.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.808
That guy's even scarier
than a thesaurus-asaurus.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.577
Tread, stomp, trudge.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.079
Growl, roar, ululate.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.448
Antonym-- whisper.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.616
What's wrong with him?

13:38.618 --> 13:39.651
He's on the spectrum.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.785
"Spectrum"?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.153
In my day we'd
throw him in the army

13:42.155 --> 13:44.189
and have him
play the bugle.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.994
Peter, this just isn't working.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.930
We can't take
proper care of Joe.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.331
It's a huge amount of work

13:53.333 --> 13:54.499
and we don't have
any idea what we're doing.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.667
Quagmire's right.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.835
It's too much.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.169
I just think he'd
be better off

13:58.171 --> 14:01.172
under the care of grumpy,
Filipino nurses.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.941
Yeah, that's why
I looked into it,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.342
and we've reserved
a place for him

14:04.344 --> 14:07.111
at the State Home for
Mentals and Bastards.

14:07.113 --> 14:10.949
Oh, my God, sometimes
they whip them with hoses...

14:10.951 --> 14:13.585
outside?!
This is perfect!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.962
Hi, I work here.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.364
I don't think
this guy works here.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.498
Hi, can I help you?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.200
Yeah, this is Joe Swanson.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.536
We arranged for a 9:15 dump-off?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.137
Go on, guys, get out of here.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.706
I'll be fine.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.707
Bye, Joe.

14:35.709 --> 14:36.708
Take care, man.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.776
See ya, Joe.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.980
Hold on, guys.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.049
There's one last thing
I got to say to my friend.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.719
Hey, Joe, you know
that movie you told me to watch

14:47.721 --> 14:49.821
that you said was
your favorite movie of all time,

14:49.823 --> 14:50.989
and you said
I had to watch it?

14:50.991 --> 14:52.891
<i>Backdraft--</i> you
finally watched it?

14:52.893 --> 14:54.325
Yeah.
Wasn't it great?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.493
I thought it was stupid.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.794
Take care, Joe.

15:03.670 --> 15:07.171
You know, tha-that state home we
left Joe in didn't seem so bad.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.339
Yeah, it's got
to be good.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.208
I mean, Napoleon Bonaparte
was there.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.243
Would the French people
let their boss walk around

15:12.245 --> 15:13.912
in stained underwear,
trying to stab people

15:13.914 --> 15:15.747
if the place wasn't nice?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.215
Yeah, no, no,
y-you're right, you're right.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.516
Joe will get
much better care there.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.251
I still feel bad.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.053
Come on, you guys.
Joe's gonna be fine.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.254
He'll fit in great there.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.423
Not like
when I went to Hogwarts.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.659
Slytherin.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.429
Hufflepuff.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.100
Housing for registered
sex offenders!

15:36.102 --> 15:38.336
Aw.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.444
Oh, Tori, thank God.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.578
Listen, you got
to unchain me.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.780
Look what Vic did.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.881
Tell me about it.

15:49.883 --> 15:51.449
He's lost his mind.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.551
That's why I'm gonna go stay
with my mother in Baltimore

15:53.553 --> 15:55.086
and work at her wife's bar.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.554
Wait, what?!

15:56.556 --> 15:57.789
Tori, come back!

15:57.791 --> 15:58.890
Damn it!

15:58.892 --> 16:00.458
Wow, shocker.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.894
Your gross hookup
from the car wash ended poorly?

16:02.896 --> 16:03.928
Stewie, thank God!

16:03.930 --> 16:05.063
How'd you find me?

16:05.065 --> 16:06.564
Well, you remember
when the vet knocked you out

16:06.566 --> 16:08.132
to take out that rotten tooth?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.934
He also put a tracking chip
in your neck.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.236
What?! That's a total
violation of my rights!

16:12.238 --> 16:14.572
Heh, I like how you're
chained up in a yard

16:14.574 --> 16:16.307
and still trying
to pretend you're a guy.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.976
Look, you got to help me.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.944
Her husband's a maniac and the
only reason he hasn't killed me

16:19.946 --> 16:21.612
is because he thinks
I'm just his pet dog.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.915
Hmm, he's got
a padlock on here.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.583
But don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.319
Well, hurry, 'cause I'm trapped
like a baseball announcer.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.088
ANNOUNCER:
And the count is two and two.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.490
Garcia steps
off the mound again,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.292
virtually guaranteeing
that my wife

16:34.294 --> 16:36.094
will be asleep when I get home.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.596
The big right-hander kicks
a little dirt and tosses

16:38.598 --> 16:41.132
the rosin bag as my children
grow up without me.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.434
Okay, and now a fan in the
stands is giving me the finger.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.669
I agree.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.004
Hey, I don't know
if you can hear it,

16:46.006 --> 16:48.873
but I'm peeing
in my coffee cup right now.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.012
There you are.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.480
Where the hell have you been?

16:55.482 --> 16:58.116
I got arrested for huckin'
a TV/VCR combo off the dam.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.018
Off the damn what?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.452
Off the damn overpass.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.121
(laughs):
Oh...

17:03.123 --> 17:04.155
God, I love you, Lois.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.623
That was like great sex.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.325
But seriously,
it-it was bad.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.459
It hit a school bus.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.694
Oh, my God!

17:09.696 --> 17:11.329
Well-well, can you
go talk to Joe?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.865
Maybe he can put in a word for
you down at the police station.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.834
Yeah, yeah, Joe, yeah, may--
yeah, maybe, maybe.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.870
Do you, uh, you-you
want a back rub?

17:18.872 --> 17:20.838
Peter, what's going on?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.306
Uh, what do you mean?

17:22.308 --> 17:23.875
Whenever you offer
me a back rub,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.810
it means you're
hiding something.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.979
(gunfire)

17:27.981 --> 17:30.048
(chickens clucking)

17:32.352 --> 17:34.385
You, hey, you-you
want a back rub?

17:34.387 --> 17:37.221
We may or may not
have put Joe

17:37.223 --> 17:39.390
in a smelly home
for the goofy.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.160
What?! Peter, those places
are a horror show!

17:42.162 --> 17:43.327
Joe's your friend!

17:43.329 --> 17:44.896
How could you treat
him like that?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.831
We just couldn't handle him
being fully paralyzed.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.399
We didn't know what else to do.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.734
But you're right.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.235
We got to get him out of there.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.904
You most certainly do.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.039
All right, how about
that back rub now?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.475
What are you, nuts?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.581
What the hell do you want?

18:03.583 --> 18:04.882
Oh, hello, sir.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.551
I'm afraid there's
been a mistake.

18:06.553 --> 18:10.254
I believe you found our dog,
and we need to take him home.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.722
No way!
Get lost, kid.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.357
He's my dog now.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
Well, we figured
you'd say no to us,

18:15.528 --> 18:18.196
but not to Vice President
Joe Biden!

18:18.198 --> 18:19.730
Oh, my God!

18:19.732 --> 18:21.032
Mr. Vice President!

18:21.034 --> 18:22.700
First, I want
to thank you, Vic,

18:22.702 --> 18:25.603
for shooting the guy
we said was Osama bin Laden.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.439
Second, give these kids
their dog back.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.209
Of course, sir,
I'm so sorry!

18:31.211 --> 18:32.610
Here, take him!

18:32.612 --> 18:33.945
Thank you.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.880
You're a great American.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.281
Thanks, Mr. Biden!

18:37.283 --> 18:38.549
No problem.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.218
Hey, you guys watch<i> Veep?</i>

18:40.220 --> 18:41.219
No.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.720
Yeah, it's all fake.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.522
Yeah, we said no.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.395
Hi, uh, we're here
to pick up Joe Swanson.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.630
Are you from the news?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.298
You have to tell us
if you're from the news.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.067
No, we're his friends.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.301
What are you guys
doing here?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.636
We came to bring
you home, Joe.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.239
We're all really sorry
we abandoned you.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.142
Yeah, we just kind of got
overwhelmed and all freaked out.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.943
But we're your
friends, Joe.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.246
And we'll always be there
for you no matter what.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.780
Thanks, guys.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.483
I'd say let's get my stuff,
but it's all been stolen.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.484
That's okay.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.286
Come on, let's go home.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.754
Sorry, no one
gets out of here

19:16.756 --> 19:18.456
without a release
from their doctor.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.659
All right, we'll just
call him right now.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.728
(phone ringing)

19:25.465 --> 19:27.532
What's that ringing?

19:31.004 --> 19:33.638
Joe, that ringing--
it's coming from your back!

19:33.640 --> 19:34.772
It is?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.174
Holy crap!

19:36.176 --> 19:38.309
Dr. Hartman must have
dropped his phone in Joe

19:38.311 --> 19:39.777
when he was looking
at his spine!

19:39.779 --> 19:40.845
Oh, thank God.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.780
I've been hearing
that ringing all week.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.282
I just thought
I was losing my mind

19:44.284 --> 19:46.684
from lunatics
screaming in my face.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.819
Your mother's a whore!

19:48.821 --> 19:52.256
I told you that
in confidence, Gary.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.296
Ah, it's so great
to have you back, Joe.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.830
You seem good as new.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.799
Yeah, it turns out Dr.
Hartman's cell phone

20:01.801 --> 20:03.701
was pressing on
my spinal cord,

20:03.703 --> 20:06.370
and that's what was causing
my total paralysis.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.539
Yeah, sorry we dropped
the ball for a while,

20:08.541 --> 20:11.142
which is the way we agreed we'd
describe what we did to you,

20:11.144 --> 20:12.877
which hopefully
makes it seem less heinous.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.312
It's all right, guys.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.047
I'm just glad to be
back on my feet.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.816
Well, you know
what I mean.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.485
(laughter)

20:21.487 --> 20:24.322
PETER:
<i>I never saw much</i>
<i>of Joe after that.</i>

20:24.324 --> 20:25.990
<i>And while he's been gone</i>
<i>for many years,</i>

20:25.992 --> 20:27.892
<i>I've never forgotten his face</i>

20:27.894 --> 20:30.428
<i>or his laughter.</i>

20:31.731 --> 20:33.731
Come on, are we
going to the beach?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.366
We've been waiting forever.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.901
Yeah, be right there,
champ.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.337
He said that the first
two times we asked.

20:39.339 --> 20:43.941
I know, he spaces out
when he's at the computer.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.584
<i>These aren't my kids.</i>

20:53.586 --> 20:55.186
<i>And also, this isn't</i>
<i>play wrestling.</i>

20:55.188 --> 20:57.255
<i>We're actually fighting.</i>
