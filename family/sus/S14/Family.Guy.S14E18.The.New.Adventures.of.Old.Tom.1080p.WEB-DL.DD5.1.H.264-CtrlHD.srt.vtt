ANNOUNCER: We now return
to<i> The Price is Right,</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:37.636
now with male models.

00:37.638 --> 00:41.874
Let's look at this beautiful
new car, presented by Ken.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.642
♪ ♪

00:43.644 --> 00:45.144
I don't want it.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.379
Peter, what the hell
happened to my underwear?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.881
They're all stretched out.

00:48.883 --> 00:49.882
Oh, sorry about that.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.083
Me and the guys
were using them

00:51.085 --> 00:53.819
to shoot crab apples
at Old Man McCratchen's truck.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.388
We don't want
raisins on Halloween,

00:56.390 --> 00:58.057
we want candy!

00:58.059 --> 01:00.225
Hey, Quagmire, aren't you
gonna get in on this?

01:00.227 --> 01:03.729
I, uh, kind of got my own
game going on over here.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.502
All right, I'm off to
get more underwear.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.037
We'll meet back
here at 2:00.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.505
Chris, do you
remember your job?

01:13.507 --> 01:16.008
To try and get my shoes
sucked into the escalator

01:16.010 --> 01:17.109
so we can sue the mall.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.610
That's right, sweetie.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.946
I heard they're paying
50 grand a toe now.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.449
(train whistle blows)

01:25.553 --> 01:27.252
Ah, the train.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.054
Now that was
the way to travel.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.189
You remember that, Chris?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.290
Not at all.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.858
When did we go
and get ourselves

01:32.860 --> 01:35.094
in such a big damn hurry?

01:35.096 --> 01:38.063
Hi, uh, I'll take two tickets
for the Ladybug Express, please.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.898
Sorry, the train is
just for children.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.366
Well, what about
that guy in the front?

01:41.368 --> 01:42.367
He's a grown-up.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.368
He's the conductor.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.903
I don't see no orchestra.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.705
That's a different
kind of conductor.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.407
Okay, well,
if he's the conductor,

01:48.409 --> 01:49.708
why don't he have
electrical tape

01:49.710 --> 01:50.876
wrapped around
him for safety?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.744
Also, a different
kind of conductor.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.546
All right, thanks for
joking around with me.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.981
We're gonna go check out
the rest of the mall.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.453
So, I'm thinking
about getting my ears pierced,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.222
you know, big black gauges.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.257
Then, I can just work
at a bike shop forever.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.291
Take the pressure off.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.426
That's a terrible idea.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.760
'Cause my lobes
are so nice,

02:08.762 --> 02:09.962
I know, that's what
everybody says.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.997
Wow, check it out.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.500
Biracial slam piece,
dead ahead.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.803
What's going on
with you, man?

02:17.805 --> 02:18.904
That's a human being.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.172
Sorry, sorry,

02:20.174 --> 02:22.141
my buddy sent me a
bunch of Romanian porn,

02:22.143 --> 02:23.475
and now every girl
I look at I imagine

02:23.477 --> 02:25.077
throwing onto a table.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.613
Yeah, that wasn't really
the backpedal I expected.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.515
Excuse me, uh, Shelby?

02:29.517 --> 02:30.649
Hi, I'm Brian.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.017
Hey, I bet lots
of millionaires

02:32.019 --> 02:33.919
come in here and hit on
you all the time, huh?

02:33.921 --> 02:34.953
(chuckles) Do we?

02:34.955 --> 02:36.255
Do we-do we do that a lot?

02:36.257 --> 02:38.090
Yeah, I guess it
happens sometimes.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.358
Did you want to
look at something?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.659
Already am.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.127
Hey, can I try that on?

02:42.129 --> 02:44.530
Good taste. That's our
nicest men's ring.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.166
Uh, better see if it'll
come off when I ski Aspen.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.770
Yeah, yeah,
that works, that works.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.173
I know I'm a nerd,
but I have, like,

02:54.175 --> 02:55.941
a thing for rich guys.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.009
I'll take the ring,

02:57.011 --> 02:59.278
and I'll take your number.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.279
Here you go.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.947
Call me.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.948
What the hell
are you doing?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.449
That ring is $10,000.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.851
Relax, Stewie.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.388
All I have to do
is bring the ring back

03:09.390 --> 03:10.822
when she's not working.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.291
I'll get a refund
and she'll never know.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.459
It's a perfect scam,
like Teddy Roosevelt

03:14.461 --> 03:16.161
getting to be
on Mount Rushmore.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.397
I won the
Revolutionary War.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.465
I won the Civil War.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.868
I gained possession of Guam!

03:25.806 --> 03:27.472
(dramatic action music
playing on video game)

03:27.474 --> 03:28.740
There you are.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.809
We were supposed
to meet an hour ago.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.144
Yeah, I'm almost done.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.645
I'm playing a really cool
new video game.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.380
<i>Michael Douglas's Munch Out.</i>

03:35.382 --> 03:36.548
Nah...

03:36.550 --> 03:39.151
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.553
Come on, Peter.
It's time to go home.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.322
Not now, Lois.
I'm making ladies feel good.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.090
Peter, I've been
on my feet all day.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.592
Let's go.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.560
I'd stop, but
Catherine Zeta Jones' big hands

03:48.562 --> 03:49.695
are on the back of my head.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.029
You know what?
Forget this.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.231
We're leaving.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.665
You find your
own way home.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.666
(video game beeps)

03:54.668 --> 03:56.235
What?
Throat cancer?

03:56.237 --> 03:59.538
But all I did was drink Scotch,
smoke cigars, and this.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.106
All right, we can go, Lois.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.174
Lois?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.014
Mort?!

04:09.016 --> 04:10.582
Oh, hey, how do you
like my blowout?

04:10.584 --> 04:13.685
I'm pulling down so
much chotch, it's insane.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.588
I don't... I-I'm... Yuck.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.757
Lois?

04:20.728 --> 04:21.793
Oh, no!

04:21.795 --> 04:23.862
I'm alone and lost in the mall!

04:23.864 --> 04:26.698
I haven't been this scared
since the silence of the lamb.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.101
Hey, um...

04:29.103 --> 04:30.535
let's move in together.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.107
Say something!

04:37.878 --> 04:39.444
...and I turned around,
and I don't know

04:39.446 --> 04:41.580
what happened to my wife,
and now I'm all alone

04:41.582 --> 04:42.748
and I'm just so scared.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.949
Okay.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.717
Do you want to go
look for your wife,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.719
or you want me to
finish the makeover?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.554
I guess we might
as well finish up here.

04:49.556 --> 04:52.858
When I find her,
I want her to go, "Wow."

04:55.796 --> 04:57.095
Lois?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.297
Lois!

04:58.299 --> 05:00.065
MAN:
Lois!

05:00.067 --> 05:01.433
Lois!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.335
Is your wife named Lois, too?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.671
No, but I figured if
she's banging a guy like you,

05:05.673 --> 05:06.738
I got a shot.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.839
Lois!

05:07.841 --> 05:09.341
Hey, what're you-- Lois!

05:09.343 --> 05:10.342
Lois!

05:10.344 --> 05:11.743
Lois!

05:15.082 --> 05:16.348
W-wait, hang on
a second, Shelby,

05:16.350 --> 05:18.083
I can't hear you
over my brokers.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.351
Buy! Sell!

05:19.353 --> 05:20.919
Buy! Buy!

05:20.921 --> 05:23.255
SHELBY:
Wow, buying<i> and</i> selling?

05:23.257 --> 05:24.323
Yeah, yeah.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.624
Well, I'll see you Saturday.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.025
I better go;
my helicopter's here.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.094
Fa-doo, fa-doo,
fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.195
Are you still--

05:30.197 --> 05:31.263
by the way, you have no idea

05:31.265 --> 05:32.464
what a helicopter sounds like--

05:32.466 --> 05:33.965
are you still keeping
up this charade?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.033
Yeah, but it's perfect.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.034
Shelby's already off work,

05:36.036 --> 05:37.536
so I'll just grab the ring

05:37.538 --> 05:39.237
and we can bring it back
before they close.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.642
Huh, I know I left
the ring right here.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.210
If you're referring to the ring

05:45.212 --> 05:47.379
that I thought was a lug nut,
I ate it.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.380
What?!

05:48.382 --> 05:49.548
Why would you eat a lug nut?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.149
I was dared.
By who?!

05:51.151 --> 05:52.150
By myself.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.785
I have low self-esteem.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.554
We should check in
on this guy more.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.055
Oh, my God,
this can't be happening!

05:57.057 --> 05:58.623
Chris, that was a diamond ring!

05:58.625 --> 06:00.392
Do you know how expensive
that was?!

06:00.394 --> 06:02.160
I'm sorry, Brian!

06:02.162 --> 06:04.563
But don't worry, it'll come out
of my body sooner or later.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.630
He's right.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.898
I ate a dime once.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.734
It became a manhole cover
for, like, three days,

06:08.736 --> 06:09.901
but then, pow!

06:09.903 --> 06:11.870
Okay, yeah, yeah,
we just-we just got to force

06:11.872 --> 06:13.071
Chris to poop, that's all.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.507
Yay! Like at a sleep-over!

06:15.509 --> 06:17.075
I love you.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.144
You're loved.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.750
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Attention-- the Quahog Mall

06:24.752 --> 06:26.685
will be closing
in five minutes.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.153
Well, I've looked everywhere.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.588
Maybe she left.

06:29.590 --> 06:33.091
Paul Blart, if you're out there,
I could sure use a miracle.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.661
(magical chords play)

06:42.603 --> 06:44.236
Choo-choo!

06:44.238 --> 06:46.505
All aboard the Ladybug Express!

06:46.507 --> 06:48.206
But be careful, Peter.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.009
If this train slows to less
than 50 miles an hour,

06:51.011 --> 06:53.378
then Sandra Bullock
has to marry a neo-Nazi

06:53.380 --> 06:54.846
and act like
she didn't know about it,

06:54.848 --> 06:57.349
and then overcompensate
by adopting a black kid.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.452
Aah! Help!

07:00.454 --> 07:01.720
(screaming)

07:01.722 --> 07:02.721
Holy crap!

07:02.723 --> 07:03.722
(screams)

07:03.724 --> 07:06.792
(Peter screaming)

07:06.794 --> 07:08.927
Wait! Don't close the mall!

07:08.929 --> 07:10.962
Like an actual Amtrak train,

07:10.964 --> 07:12.964
this is dangerously
out of control!

07:12.966 --> 07:14.966
That's legally defensible,
by the way.

Good morning, I'm Tom Tucker.

Coming up, the secret
to remaining upbeat

07:35.722 --> 07:37.322

an elderly waitress.

07:37.324 --> 07:40.425
But we begin with breaking news
from the Quahog Mall,

where a local fat man was stuck
overnight on a child's train.

Dallas Portland.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.668
Thanks, Tom.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.769
Yes, quite an ordeal

07:50.771 --> 07:52.671
for Quahog's Peter Griffin.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.941
So, Mr. Griffin, you were going
around in circles for 12 hours.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.509
Are you suffering
any ill effects

07:57.511 --> 07:59.010
from the centrifugal force?

07:59.012 --> 08:03.081
The wind on my skin
is like "knifes."

08:04.017 --> 08:05.083
(phone keys beeping)

08:05.085 --> 08:06.351
Oh, my God, Bonnie,

08:06.353 --> 08:07.853
are you watching
the news right now?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.155
Yes, I'm so sorry
about Peter.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.623
Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.125
But did you see that
sweet, new piece of ass,

08:14.127 --> 08:15.327
Dallas Portland?

08:15.329 --> 08:16.695
Oh, I don't know.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.531
Why don't you ask my
index and middle finger?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.533
I thought this
was a recovery day.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.668
No days off, bro.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.875
Peter, move,
we need the TV.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.710
Is this...
is this a coven?

08:31.712 --> 08:32.944
No, we're watching the news.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.546
Now get out of the way.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.848
We had a bottle of wine
and a joint at Bonnie's house,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.383
and we want to watch
Dallas Portland

08:38.385 --> 08:39.951
before the buzz wears off.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.454
You chicken-heads
are out of control.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.190
Yoga for men?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.626
Yes, says the
inventor of Bro-ga.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.895
I'm here in his studio
above the Petco to see

08:49.897 --> 08:52.797
if I want to "nama-stay"
for the whole class.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.566
(women laughing)

08:54.568 --> 08:56.568
I guess he's handsome<i> and</i> funny.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.037
Oh, feel like I'm cheating
on Tom Bergeron.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.705
That's who you're
all excited about?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.741
That chiseled Adonis
with eyes the color

09:02.743 --> 09:04.175
of summer's first
blueberry?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.844
I don't know
about none of that,

09:05.846 --> 09:07.746
but look at that bulge
in his shorts.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.147
I've never seen a bulge

09:09.149 --> 09:11.182
in the front of
a man's pants before.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.484
You see that, Peter?

09:12.486 --> 09:14.252
That's the right amount
of leg hair.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.687
My leg hair's fine.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.423
I have what they call,
"The Irish Wisp."

09:23.397 --> 09:25.397
Why are we at a
health food store?

09:25.399 --> 09:26.765
Well, we got to get
that ring out of you,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.099
and this is a place
where people buy

09:28.101 --> 09:30.101
disgusting cereals
to help them poop.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.503
Well, which one
should we buy?

09:31.505 --> 09:33.038
I don't know, let's ask.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.407
Are there any gray-haired
lesbian art teachers

09:35.409 --> 09:37.909
who can help us select
a fiber cereal?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.377
This won't take long.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.113
We know your large dogs
are tied up outside.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.282
(women chattering)

09:44.284 --> 09:45.550
There's too many of them!

09:45.552 --> 09:46.785
We've got to start a chant

09:46.787 --> 09:48.253
so they'll file out
into the street!

09:48.255 --> 09:51.790
All sex is rape!
All sex is rape!

09:51.792 --> 09:55.360
PROTESTORS: All sex is rape!
All sex is rape!

09:55.362 --> 09:56.928
When I first joined this cause,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.964
I was just trying
to get this guy to poop,

09:58.966 --> 10:01.933
but now we're this close
to getting sex outlawed

10:01.935 --> 10:03.134
in the United States.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.036
(crowd cheers)

10:09.710 --> 10:12.210
So, Peter, where are
your boyfriends tonight?

10:12.212 --> 10:13.478
I don't know.
Where are yours?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.113
What the (bleep)
did you just say?!

10:15.115 --> 10:16.982
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sor... I-I'm just...

10:16.984 --> 10:18.483
I'm not myself tonight.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.818
Lois and all
of her friends

10:19.820 --> 10:21.419
are drooling over
that new news guy.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.321
That Dallas Portland's a jerk.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.090
TOM:
Don't even say that name.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.324
Tom Tucker?!

10:26.326 --> 10:27.492
What are you doing here?

10:27.494 --> 10:28.927
Getting out of that wind storm

10:28.929 --> 10:30.929
that screwed up my hair
and loosened my tie,

10:30.931 --> 10:32.430
but also trying to forget

10:32.432 --> 10:34.299
how mad I am at Dallas Portland.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.600
You and me both, pal.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.768
That Dallas guy sucks.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.470
Why, what's your
problem with him?

10:38.472 --> 10:40.672
Eh, my wife's been creaming
her spinach over him.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.307
Yeah, tell me about it.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.175
Since he arrived,
our ratings have skyrocketed.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.978
They're grooming Dallas,
which means I'm on my way out.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.414
What?
We can't let that happen.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.449
If that guy becomes the anchor,
every night is gonna be...

10:51.451 --> 10:53.118
Hey!

10:53.120 --> 10:55.320
Sorry, I still get a little
dizzy from the train,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.422
but if Dallas Portland's
on TV every night,

10:57.424 --> 10:59.424
my life's gonna be
a living hell.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.925
You and me both.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.261
Without the news, I...
I don't know who I am...

11:03.263 --> 11:04.496
but what can you do?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.031
He's the flavor of the month.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.333
But wait a minute,
maybe if we work together,

11:08.335 --> 11:09.968
we can solve both our problems.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.136
What do you mean?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.671
Well, if he's
the hot, young thing

11:12.673 --> 11:14.939
and everybody loves him,
all we got to do is make you

11:14.941 --> 11:16.708
hotter and
younger and thing-er!

11:16.710 --> 11:18.043
And then they
won't need him.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.210
Well, how we supposed
to do that?

11:19.212 --> 11:20.712
Just trust me.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.547
When I set my mind to something,
anything's possible.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.883
That's how I got
myself on<i> The Voice.</i>

11:24.885 --> 11:26.484
(crying):
I'm doing this for my mother,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.987
who taught me to sing
when I was only seven.

11:28.989 --> 11:32.490
She was my biggest inspiration,
and she was...

11:32.492 --> 11:35.960
taken from me when I was 12...

11:35.962 --> 11:38.363
in a fatal car accident.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.333
She was my rock...
my beacon...

11:42.335 --> 11:44.402
and this one...

11:44.404 --> 11:45.804

11:45.806 --> 11:47.806

All right, Chris, nothing's
gotten that ring out yet.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.051
That's why we brought
you to this fast-food

13:07.053 --> 13:08.586
roast beef restaurant.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.089
Uh, yeah, I'll take
the Angus steak melt.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.624
I'm sorry, are you here
to poop something out?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.125
Yes.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.994
Okay, this line is just
for regular diners.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.362
You need to get
in that line.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.766
Excuse me, is this the line
for people who need

13:21.768 --> 13:23.001
to puke something up?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.669
I think this is
just the poop line.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.006
Cheers.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.042
You know what restaurant
we're talking about.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.914
Ah, almost time
for the news.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.081
Mind if I join you?

hated the news.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.588
Okay.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.157
Good evening, Quahog,
I'm Dallas Portland.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.425
And I'm T-Homie...

13:47.427 --> 13:50.929
with the news
in your mouth!

13:50.931 --> 13:52.630
What the hell's he doing?

13:52.632 --> 13:54.165
He's crushing it.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.368
Okay, Tom, uh,
our top story tonight:

13:57.370 --> 13:59.838
a burst water pipe

of Quahog General

14:02.209 --> 14:04.843

of four children and one nurse.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.611
News bomb! (laughs)

14:06.613 --> 14:07.879
I know what you're
thinking, right?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.180
"He's so random."

14:09.182 --> 14:10.648
Boy, I never realized

14:10.650 --> 14:12.817
how young and hip
Tom Tucker is.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.386
Dallas Portland should just
pack it up and go home.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.521
What are you talking about?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.022
Wait, wait, quiet, quiet.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.958
Tom's about to tattoo
the word, "Coachella"

14:19.960 --> 14:21.292
on the bridge of his nose.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.894
Is that a thing?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.529
Uh, I don't know, Grandma,
sit back and wa--

14:24.531 --> 14:25.630

(both screaming)

14:25.632 --> 14:26.798
He got his eye!
Oh, God!

14:26.800 --> 14:28.333
What's wrong
with you, Dallas?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.468
Never seen a guy so
young and cool before?

14:30.470 --> 14:31.469
(coughs)

14:31.471 --> 14:32.637
Tumblr!

14:34.541 --> 14:36.307

Channel Five News anchor
Tom Tucker has been relieved

14:39.346 --> 14:41.546

14:41.548 --> 14:43.348
Holy crap! They fired him?

14:43.350 --> 14:44.582
Oh, my God!

14:44.584 --> 14:46.584
Oh, well,

Peter, you were
the one who told

15:09.843 --> 15:12.577
Tom Tucker to try
all that nonsense on TV?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.179
You realize you cost
that man his job.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.748
Well, how was
I supposed to know?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.917
Katie Couric went on TV
and stuck a tube up her butt

15:18.919 --> 15:20.051
and they threw her a parade.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.686
That was a colonoscopy!

15:21.688 --> 15:23.388
This is kind of
your fault, you know.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.589
I mean, you're the
one who was drooling

15:24.591 --> 15:26.090
over that Dallas Portland.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.792
I was just trying to get
that guy off the air.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.560
Peter, that's ridiculous.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.530
He's just some pretty boy
who doesn't mean anything.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.565
It's like when you watch
<i>Mad Men</i> for that chick

15:34.567 --> 15:36.034
you said was like a fat me.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.969
I said a young, fat you.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.738
The point is,
you've ruined that man's life.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.106
(sighs)
You're right.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.308
Poor Tom.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.076
Thanks to me,
he's fallen even

15:45.078 --> 15:46.878
further than Charlie Rose.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.151
from the night before.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.552
That's not what
we're talking about.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.454
That's what
<i>I'm</i> talking about.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.492
I don't know
what else to do.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.760
We've tried everything.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.429
Brian, the jeweler
closes at 6:00.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.331
You don't have much time left
to return that ring.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.332
You're right.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.933
Well, we have no choice.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.735
We'll just have to take
a bumpy ride to the mall

16:10.737 --> 16:12.136
and hope for a miracle.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.105
You know, Brian,
this wouldn't have happened

16:14.107 --> 16:15.506
if you were just
honest with women

16:15.508 --> 16:16.908
and had an ounce
of integrity.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.242
Don't pull rank on me.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.311
You ate a ring,
you worthless tub of crap.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.647
Yeah? Well, who's gonna
be fishing through

16:22.649 --> 16:25.450
a tub of crap soon,
you unemployed buttmunch?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.418
Whoa, whoa,
let's calm down, guys.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.854
Shut up,
you unemployed buttmunch!

16:29.856 --> 16:32.223
Okay, he found
a burn he likes.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.031
What the hell do you want?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.199
I'm here to say...

16:41.201 --> 16:43.201
I'm sorry about
what happened.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.669
Let me make it up to you.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.537
I'm the one who made
you lose your job.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.839
I'll find you a new one.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.008
Don't bother. I'm washed up.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.543
Everyone saw what I did,
and besides, I...

16:52.545 --> 16:54.445
I can't do anything else.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.547
I was born to be a newsman.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.883
This just out: me!

16:58.885 --> 17:00.551
That-that happened?

17:00.553 --> 17:01.719
Is that for real?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.154
That's nuts, but still,

17:03.156 --> 17:04.889
I-I want to help you
get back on your feet.

17:04.891 --> 17:05.890
Go home, Peter.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.191
You've already done enough.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.693
Thanks to you,
it's over for me,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.461
like Billy Zane.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.662
Billy, you're through.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.897
You haven't done
anything in ten years.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.532
Yes, I have.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.501
I was in those electronic
cigarette commercials.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.869
That was Stephen Dorff.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.637
Aw.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.576
How we doing on time?
Less than a minute.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.878
How you feeling, Chris?

17:26.880 --> 17:29.080
No different, except I have
to poop from all this running.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.348
What? That's great!

17:30.350 --> 17:31.549
There's a bathroom
down that hall!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.251
No time!
They're closing the gate!

17:33.253 --> 17:36.788
(suspenseful
action music playing)

17:43.830 --> 17:44.829
BRIAN:
<i>Hey, Shelby.</i>

17:44.831 --> 17:46.164
SHELBY:
<i>Brian?</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:47.865
CHRIS (groaning):
<i>It's coming!</i>

17:47.867 --> 17:50.001
(splat)
SHELBY:<i> Oh, my God!</i>

17:50.003 --> 17:51.936
BRIAN:<i> Yes, um, I'd like to make</i>
<i>a return, please...</i>

17:51.938 --> 17:54.105
<i>and maybe take you to dinner?</i>

17:54.107 --> 17:57.008
SHELBY:<i> Brian, I don't care</i>
<i>that I was diarrhea'd on.</i>

17:57.010 --> 17:59.544
<i>I care that you weren't honest.</i>

17:59.546 --> 18:01.412
STEWIE:<i> I care that</i>
<i>I was diarrhea'd on.</i>

18:01.414 --> 18:03.614
<i>I care a great deal.</i>

18:08.421 --> 18:10.755
Sorry I let you down, Tom.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.256
Oh, my God, look!

18:12.258 --> 18:13.458
Up on the roof!

18:15.261 --> 18:16.561
Holy crap!

18:16.563 --> 18:18.996
Doritos Tacos is only
for a limited time?

18:19.966 --> 18:21.432
And oh, no!

18:21.434 --> 18:23.768
Tom Tucker's gonna jump!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.542
Tom, I got here as
fast as I could.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.277
So-so, what's-what's
going on?

18:33.279 --> 18:34.579
It's over for me, Peter.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.314
If I can't anchor
the local news,

18:36.316 --> 18:37.949
I have no reason to live.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.051
Look, Tom, Tom, before
you do anything crazy,

18:40.053 --> 18:41.486
you should know one thing:

18:41.488 --> 18:44.155
I have that exact
same bathrobe.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.157
Hey, Tom, the camera's
gonna be on you in a second.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.825
Before you jump,
could you just hand me

18:47.827 --> 18:50.495
this microphone, like you're
passing me the torch?

18:50.497 --> 18:51.996
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:51.998 --> 18:52.997
What am I doing?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.499
Getting an interview
with a crazed jumper

18:54.501 --> 18:55.566
on the brink of suicide.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.667
This is huge.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.236
Wait a second.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.670
You heard wrong, Dallas.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.906
There's a jumper here,
but it ain't Tom.

19:01.908 --> 19:02.907
It's me.
What?!

19:02.909 --> 19:04.175
That's right.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.676
Tom was just trying
to talk me down,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.678
and if there's
a news story here,

19:07.680 --> 19:10.681
the only one I'm giving
it to is Tom Tucker.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.917
Here.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.585
Roll it.

19:15.755 --> 19:16.787
Good evening, Quahog.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.322
This is Tom Tucker
atop a roof,

19:18.324 --> 19:21.526
where a local crazy person
is preparing to end it all.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.593
Bonnie!

19:22.595 --> 19:24.695
Tom Tucker's back on the news!

19:24.697 --> 19:26.030
Oh, here you are.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.031
Tom Tucker's back...

19:27.033 --> 19:28.199
I know.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.635
Honey, I'm back on TV.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.336
No, Billy,
that's Tom Tucker.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.871
Aw.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.706
What's going on?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.042
Don't worry about it,
just get those pants off.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.611
Oh, your hair is amazing.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.548
Tell us, crazy person,
why are you doing all this?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.016
I'll tell you why.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.385
I'm doing this because
I ruined a guy's life...

19:47.387 --> 19:49.020
and I feel awful about it.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.456
It's the only thing I can think
of to make things right.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.727
Well, whoever this guy is,
I'm sure he appreciates

19:56.729 --> 19:58.296
what you're trying
to do for him.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.731
I think I speak for all
our viewers when I say,

20:00.733 --> 20:02.233
don't do this.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.634
Please.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.069
Come down off
this ledge with me.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.804
You got it.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.208
If that's what the most trusted
newsman in Quahog wants.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.077
Aah! Pigeon!

20:13.079 --> 20:14.078
(Tom yells)

20:14.080 --> 20:15.246
(Tom thuds, groans)

20:15.248 --> 20:16.247
It's fine.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.315
He landed on people.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.090
Well, I'm glad
your crazy stunt worked out

20:26.092 --> 20:27.758
and Tom Tucker is back
at Channel Five.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.026
Yeah, apparently,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.595
when he interviewed me
up on that roof,

20:30.597 --> 20:32.930
the ratings were so huge,
they made him anchor again.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.432
That's great
to hear, because...

20:34.434 --> 20:37.268
MAN (distant):
Lois! Lois!

20:37.270 --> 20:38.836
I-Is somebody
calling my name?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.671
Lois!

20:40.673 --> 20:41.772
I don't think so, no.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.374
Lois, I'm rich!

20:43.376 --> 20:45.243
Now I think I do
hear something.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.011
I should probably
go see what he wants.

20:47.013 --> 20:51.182
I know I'm a nerd, but I have,
like, a thing for rich guys.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.020
Oh, boy, she's getting
in his helicopter.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.388
Fa-doo, fa-doo,
fa-doo, fa-doo,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.523
fa-doo, fa-doo,
fa-doo, fa-doo, fa-doo...

20:59.525 --> 21:02.526
Well, I'm big enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.029
(jazzy instrumental version
of theme song playing)
