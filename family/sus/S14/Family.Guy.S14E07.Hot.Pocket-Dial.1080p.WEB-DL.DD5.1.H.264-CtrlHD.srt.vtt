Ah, Smitty's Steakhouse.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.305
You know, this was the
fanciest restaurant in Quahog

00:40.307 --> 00:41.540
when I was a kid.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.342
The ladies' room has a big space

00:43.344 --> 00:45.077
with chairs in it,
like a living room,

00:45.079 --> 00:47.012
before you get back
to where the crappers are.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.847
Good evening and
welcome to Smitty's.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.849
I'll be back with
martinis for Mom and Dad,

00:50.851 --> 00:53.552
and for you kids,
some martinis.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.220
Dad, can you pass
the bread?

00:55.222 --> 00:57.656
Sure. But don't forget
the butter that looks like

00:57.658 --> 01:00.959
decorative bathroom soaps and
is impossible to smear.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.666
Thanks, Dad!
This really ruins it!

01:07.668 --> 01:09.401
What will you
be having, sir?

01:09.403 --> 01:12.004
Yes, I'll have what I had last
time: pheasant on the glass.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.906
Don't you mean
"pheasant under glass"?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.174
Nope.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.242
(chirping)

01:17.244 --> 01:21.313
Yeah. Now turn around
and lay an egg on the glass.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.684
Aw, yeah.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.455
I defy you to tell me
exactly what's wrong with this.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.561
Oh, Peter, look.
You can put your business card

01:35.563 --> 01:37.563
in this bowl
and maybe win a free lunch.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.398
I don't have a
business card.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.600
And I think
you knew that.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.035
I hope you enjoyed
your meal, sir.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.403
May I offer you
a toothpick?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.971
Oh, I-I don't know.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.073
We've already spent
a lot of money in here tonight.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.843
No, sir, it-it's free.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.947
Oh!

01:58.052 --> 02:00.052
Peter, that's not
how you use a toothpick.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.553
You pick your teeth
with it.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.123
I cannot believe
I have to explain this to you.

02:04.125 --> 02:07.192
There are gaps in my knowledge.
This is hardly news.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.996
Wow, this is awesome!

02:10.998 --> 02:13.465
This is like
I'm having a whole second meal!

02:15.803 --> 02:18.070
Man, this just feels right.

02:18.072 --> 02:21.140
That's it. From here on out, I
am about all things toothpick.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.642
I'm gonna go everywhere with
it, always be chewing on it,

02:23.644 --> 02:25.410
and start all my
sentences with,

02:25.412 --> 02:27.246
"All right, here's
what you're gonna do."

02:27.248 --> 02:28.981
Excuse me, we're
from out of town.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.617
Where do people go to listen
to live music around here?

02:31.619 --> 02:33.619
I'll handle this. All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.454
Skip the live music.
Get yourself a room

02:35.456 --> 02:37.623
over at the Wickford Marina.
Take her out on a balcony,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.825
point to any boat in the harbor,
and tell her it's yours.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.960
Now, you got rubbers?
Now that I'm a toothpick guy,

02:41.962 --> 02:43.962
I call 'em rubbers.
Or you could just pull the hose

02:43.964 --> 02:46.265
out of the bucket
and let it spray free.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.567
I've had a vasectomy.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.006
Chris, now that I'm a toothpick
guy, it's my job to sit

02:54.008 --> 02:56.008
on a BMX bike
outside the rec center

02:56.010 --> 02:58.477
and ask every kid
if they're the new kid.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.479
Hey. You the new kid?

03:00.481 --> 03:02.147
Why?
Never mind why.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.649
Got any cool toys?

03:03.651 --> 03:05.217
Uh, I got an Xbox.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.686
How about you?
I got a Barbie
with a wiener on it.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.689
Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe,
put it on with superglue.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.991
Looks pretty real.
Real enough, anyways.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.960
Does the job.
Does what job?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.662
You get it.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.331
My family moves around a lot
'cause I do stuff like this.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.832
Um, okay.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.701
I got to go now.
You sure you don't want

03:22.703 --> 03:24.670
to come over and pull
on my cat's nipples?

03:24.672 --> 03:28.073
We can do anything,
'cause my mom has two jobs.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.543
All right,
I'm off to the fish market.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.145
What? Why?

03:33.147 --> 03:35.214
Well, the most intimidating
people are toothpick guys

03:35.216 --> 03:37.382
who work at seafood counters
and make people uncomfortable

03:37.384 --> 03:39.318
for not knowing
about fish.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.752
What's good here?
It's all good.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.321
What's the freshest?
It's all fresh.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.389
How 'bout the halibut?
Is it gamey?
Gamey?

03:44.391 --> 03:46.692
I mean, you know,
is it fishy?
It's all fish.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.394
Is there a special way
to prepare it?
I'd cook it up.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.029
W-Well, what's
the best fish here?

03:51.031 --> 03:52.664
What's your favorite fish?

03:52.666 --> 03:55.133
I don't eat fish.
I only like spaghetti.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.873
Ugh, when are you gonna
get rid of that toothpick?

04:01.875 --> 04:04.376
It's disgusting,
and it's starting to smell.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.445
Why would I give it up?
It's getting me tons of tail.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.446
What?

04:07.448 --> 04:08.680
And check this out.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.949
The rare triple toothpick flip.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.188
(choking)

04:16.190 --> 04:18.423
Oh, my God,
are you all right?

04:18.425 --> 04:20.259
(coughs)
No, I swallowed it!

04:20.261 --> 04:22.027
My toothpick! It's gone!

04:22.029 --> 04:24.096
Damn it! I'm gonna need
you to put that large

04:24.098 --> 04:25.731
two-handed colander
over the toilet.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.733
Peter, that was
a wedding present from my aunt.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.134
Well, let's use
the ice cream maker!

04:29.136 --> 04:30.569
We've never used it once!

04:30.571 --> 04:33.305
Calm down. You can always
get another toothpick.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.906
Oh, my God, you're right!

04:34.908 --> 04:36.408
Lois, we got to drive
to Smitty's right now

04:36.410 --> 04:38.210
and get one.
Now?

04:38.212 --> 04:41.613
But we told Chris we'd be there
when he wakes up from surgery.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.384
All right, we were able
to fix your hernia,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.786
but you've got to stop
lifting sewer hole covers.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.454
But the Ninja Turtles
live down there.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.789
I'm friends with them.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.891
Hey, fat ass,
I brought you flowers.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.627
But stay out of the sewers!
We're trying to work down there.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.896
Thanks, Donatello!

04:57.898 --> 04:59.631
(tires screech)

04:59.633 --> 05:01.066
Oh, thank God!

05:01.068 --> 05:02.934
Quick, we need
another toothpick!

05:02.936 --> 05:06.371
Thank you, Maurice.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.016
Just get your toothpick
and let's get out of here.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.418
Ugh. No, thanks.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.787
That old lady has ruined
toothpicks for me.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.989
Just like how Meg
ruined broccoli.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.991
Hey, Meg, look,
they're little trees!

05:25.993 --> 05:27.292
No, they're not.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.494
They're not?!

05:29.496 --> 05:31.963
Hey, Peter!

05:31.965 --> 05:34.633
Oh, look, there's Quagmire
and his transgendered mother,

05:34.635 --> 05:37.669
which is now great.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.171
Hey, Quagmire. Hey, Ida.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.839
I didn't know
you liked Smitty's.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.507
Oh, yeah, I've been
coming here for ages.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.276
They even named a sandwich
after me.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.678
It's an inside-out hot dog
slathered in ketchup.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.680
Please, please
join us.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.683
Oh, we wouldn't want
to interrupt your brave dinner.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.485
Nonsense, we're happy
to have you.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.053
All right,
but we already ate dinner,

05:55.055 --> 05:58.657
so maybe just an iceberg wedge,
a steak and some sides.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.026
And then I said something random
that suggested

06:01.028 --> 06:02.694
a whole crazy story!

06:02.696 --> 06:05.030
(laughter)

06:05.032 --> 06:07.032
Oh, God, that's
hilarious, Lois.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.867
I could listen to
you talk all night.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.470
Yeah, but we got to get going.
Carter's our babysitter,

06:11.472 --> 06:14.639
and if he's with the kids too
long, they start saying racisms.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.641
Aw, I wish the fun
didn't have to end.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.211
I always enjoy spending time
with you two.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.012
Well, why don't you
come over tomorrow?

06:21.014 --> 06:24.349
We'll fire up the grill and have
the gang over for a cookout.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.752
Well, that
sounds wonderful.
Well, great, we'll be there!

06:26.754 --> 06:28.687
Hey, before you two
leave, let's take a photo.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.022
Yeah! Selfie!
(laughs)

06:31.024 --> 06:33.458
I just learned that word.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.897
Perfect! Well, good
night, you guys.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.233
See you tomorrow,
hashtags!

06:41.235 --> 06:43.635
You're not doing
that right.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.508
Boy, that Lois is really
something, isn't she?

06:49.510 --> 06:52.411
Yeah. Peter's a lucky guy.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.379
Glenn, do you...

06:54.381 --> 06:56.381
do you have feelings for her?

06:56.383 --> 06:57.749
What? (scoffs)

06:57.751 --> 06:58.750
No.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.185
A mother always knows.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.187
You like to play the
field, but, deep down,

07:02.189 --> 07:04.923
you really wish you had a
woman like Lois, don't you?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.125
No, I don't want a woman
<i>like</i> Lois.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.860
I want Lois.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.962
She's perfect.
I've loved her for years.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.465
She's warm and kind
and beautiful.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.934
I've never been so in love
with anyone.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.769
Glenn, that's
very sweet,

07:17.771 --> 07:20.272
but you're talking about
your best friend's wife.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.873
I know, I know.
It's wrong.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.275
And Peter's
a good friend.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.210
Not like Cleveland.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.279
Hey, I got two
of these phone books.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.880
Didn't know
if you wanted one.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.049
Hey, how long
have we known each other?

07:31.051 --> 07:35.053
Long time. And yet we've never
discussed mothers' maiden names,

07:35.055 --> 07:38.290
the names of old pets,
high school mascots,

07:38.292 --> 07:39.658
favorite teachers.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.126
Heck, I don't even know

07:41.128 --> 07:42.727
the last four digits
of your Social.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.563
Cleveland, do you need
to borrow some money?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.798
I do!
They're gonna kill Donna!

07:46.800 --> 07:49.801
Really?
No. I just want
to buy a man's fur coat.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.636
Get out of here.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.339
(distant knocking)

07:54.341 --> 07:56.107
(door opens in distance)
Hey, Peter,

07:56.109 --> 07:57.943
I had an extra
phone book, and I...

07:57.945 --> 08:00.312
PETER: I'm not buying you
that coat!
(door slams)

08:03.784 --> 08:05.317
(snoring)

08:07.254 --> 08:08.920
(coughing)
Huh? Who? What?

08:08.922 --> 08:10.922
Yeah, what? What? Which
doggy in what window?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.591
So, how'd everything go?

08:12.593 --> 08:14.426
Hard to tell. I was
coughing the whole time.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.428
By the way, I couldn't figure
out how to use your oven,

08:16.430 --> 08:18.163
so I destroyed it
in a blind rage.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.965
Well, good night.

08:19.967 --> 08:23.969
Ooh, after that steak, I got
to go lay down on the toilet.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.804
(phone vibrates)

08:25.806 --> 08:27.639
Huh. Looks like I got
a couple of messages.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.808
(banging noises over phone)
STEWIE (recorded): Uh, Dad? Dad?

08:29.810 --> 08:31.309
Grandpa's going nuts
on the oven.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.544
Can you come home quick?

08:32.546 --> 08:34.045
Who the hell is that?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.314
Huh. There's one from Quagmire.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.949
(muffled conversation)

08:37.951 --> 08:39.484
Huh, must've
pocket-dialed me again.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.987
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.555
I've loved her for years.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.157
She's warm and kind
and beautiful.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.159
I've never been so in love
with anyone.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.495
Oh, my God!

08:50.497 --> 08:52.397
Quagmire's in love with my wife?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.232
(phone vibrates)
Hello?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.234
LOIS: Peter, I'm having troubles
on the toilet.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.702
Bring the ice cream maker.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.978
Brian, there's something I
got to talk to you about.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.080
Quagmire pocket-dialed
me last night.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.182
You got to hear this.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.351
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.819
I've loved her for years.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.221
Oh, my God!

09:16.223 --> 09:17.856
He's in love with Lois?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.524
Yeah, and if you keep
listening, you can hear

09:19.526 --> 09:22.060
a Puerto Rican busboy get
fired in the background.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.395
It's pretty funny.
He cries.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.696
But can you
believe Quagmire?!

09:24.698 --> 09:26.364
Well, I guess
it's not that shocking.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.100
I mean, he has said 100 times
that he wants to bang Lois.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.269
No, no, no, that's just
Quagmire being a horn-dog.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.071
This is love.
I don't know.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.206
I think you're making
too big a deal out of this.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.509
Too big a deal?! The guy's
been sitting next to me

09:37.511 --> 09:39.210
all these years,
acting like he's my friend,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.446
when all he really wants
is to be with my wife!

09:41.448 --> 09:43.181
Geez, calm down.
No, I'm telling you,

09:43.183 --> 09:45.250
he's gonna try to take
Lois away from me.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.218
You know what? I'm going
over there right now

09:47.220 --> 09:50.021
and hit him with a shovel, like
a white trash YouTube girl.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.523
Peter, wait, wait.
Listen.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.458
Delete that message
and pretend you never heard it.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.926
What? Why?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.795
Because you weren't meant
to hear it.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.464
If you act on this, all you'll
do is wreck your friendship

09:59.466 --> 10:01.299
and cause heartache
for everyone involved.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.401
What, so what am I supposed
to do, just ignore it?

10:03.403 --> 10:04.436
Yeah. Ignore it.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.538
Like you do with the ghost
of that colonial woman

10:06.540 --> 10:08.239
who died
falling down our stairs.

10:08.241 --> 10:12.377
(moaning): I saw
you eat a crayon.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.746
It was purple.
I thought it was grape.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.881
Look, you've got to be
the bigger man.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.883
You got to just keep this
to yourself.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.952
(sighs) Fine, I
won't say anything.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.088
Good. And don't be
passive-aggressive, either.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.924
Like one of those songs
in an old musical.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.125

10:51.752 --> 10:54.152
Oh, yeah, Mort
<i>and</i> Neil Goldman.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.154
It's like Coachella.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.292
There's that son of a bitch.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.294
He's got some nerve
showing up here.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.163
Peter, remember what
we talked about.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.865
Look at them clouds
up there.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.466
Yeah, that one
look like Nathan.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.101
That one look
like Shawn.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.636
And there go Wanya
over there.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.639
How blessed are we to have
all them Boyz II Men

11:14.641 --> 11:16.941
just floating around
in the sky?

11:16.943 --> 11:18.810
Glenn! Ida!
You made it!

11:18.812 --> 11:21.479
Hey, Lois. I brought the
hamburger buns, like you wanted.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.014
I wasn't sure
what people like,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.383
so I got some with seeds on them
and some without.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.519
What does he mean
by that, "seeds"?

11:27.521 --> 11:29.354
Like semen?
Is that what he means?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.157
Semen on her buns.
Am I the only one hearing this?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.626
Get the hell away from my wife,
you scumbag!

11:34.628 --> 11:36.194
Peter, what are you
talking about?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.662
I'll tell you
what I'm talking about!

11:37.664 --> 11:38.997
I'm talking about this!

11:38.999 --> 11:40.865
PETER (recorded):
Idea for a movie.

11:40.867 --> 11:44.402
<i>Fop Cop.</i> It's a cop
who's, like, a fancy guy.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.471
Nobody heard that!
None of you take that!

11:46.473 --> 11:48.740
What I meant to play was this.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.875
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.677
I've loved her for years.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.313
<i>Fop Cop.</i>
That could work.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.382
Glenn...
i-is this true?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.984
Wait a minute, how the hell'd
you get that recording, Peter?

11:59.986 --> 12:02.020
You pocket-dialed me,
you bastard!

12:02.022 --> 12:03.822
Peter, that was a
private conversation.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.058
That doesn't change the fact
that you want to steal my wife!

12:07.060 --> 12:09.127
Hey, get your
hands off me!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.663
LOIS:
Oh, my God!

12:11.665 --> 12:13.331
JOE:
Oh, come on, you two.
CLEVELAND: Come on, now.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.566
Hey, what are y'all doing?
Stop! Stop it!

12:14.568 --> 12:15.767
Kill him, Dad!

12:15.769 --> 12:17.235
Murder him!

12:18.205 --> 12:19.871
(Quagmire and Peter grunting)

12:19.873 --> 12:21.706
That's it!
End of cookout!

12:21.708 --> 12:25.410
Get out of my house, and don't
ever speak to me again!

12:26.847 --> 12:28.847
Wow, that turned ugly fast.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.182
Just like my trip to Tampa Bay.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.352
Hey, city boy,
what's with the arm pants?

12:39.626 --> 12:41.760
QUAGMIRE:
I want Lois. She's perfect.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.461
I've loved her for years.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.563
(groans) You're still
listening to that thing?

12:45.565 --> 12:49.434
It's like, I can't even process
why he'd feel this way.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.770
Maybe... you know, maybe
play it one more time and...

12:51.772 --> 12:53.605
I can't believe this.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.440
I thought Quagmire
was my friend!

12:55.442 --> 12:57.442
Peter, it's not
that surprising.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.744
He's always had a
potent sex drive.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.380
Remember his
grandmother's funeral?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.450
(quietly):
Yeah, get it in there.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.118
Oh, I<i> wish</i> this was
about sex.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.721
If he was just home
busting one to his buddy's wife,

13:09.723 --> 13:11.456
hell, we've all done that.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.091
I've heard. Allegedly.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.093
But not often.
And never to Donna.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.095
Except when she wore
those shiny gold shorts

13:17.097 --> 13:18.263
to parent-teacher night.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.331
Oh, yeah, that
was hilarious.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.834
(laughs): Yeah, that was...
that was so tacky.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.904
But if Quagmire actually has
feelings for you,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.673
I'm afraid he might take you
away from me.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.075
Peter, nobody's
taking me anywhere.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.844
I love<i> you.</i>

13:32.846 --> 13:33.845
Mmm.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.680
I love you, too, Lois.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.749
Hey, you ever heard
any of the other wives

13:37.751 --> 13:39.117
saying they're
attracted to me?

13:39.119 --> 13:40.485
(laughs)

13:40.487 --> 13:42.987
No, um, not that
I recall, no.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.823
Look, now that
this is settled,

13:44.825 --> 13:47.091
maybe you and Glenn can
put this behind you.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.594
No way! How am I supposed
to be friends with someone

13:49.596 --> 13:50.995
who's in love with my wife?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.497
Quagmire is dead to me

13:52.499 --> 13:55.033
and needs to be dealt with
in an appropriate manner.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.135
Shame.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.937
Shame.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.371
Shame.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.539
(bell rings)

14:01.541 --> 14:02.941
Shame.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.844

Glenn? Is that you?

14:25.131 --> 14:26.497
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.534
I was just buying a...
a... grocery store cane.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.069
See you, Lois.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.037
Glenn, wait.
Look, if you and Peter

14:33.039 --> 14:36.207
aren't gonna talk this out,
you and I should.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.976
What's there
to talk about?

14:37.978 --> 14:40.178
Everyone knows I'm in love
with my best friend's wife.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.980
It's pathetic.
And humiliating.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.147
Glenn...

14:43.149 --> 14:45.049
I can't trust myself
around you.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.319
It's probably best if I...
just never see you again.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.555
Well, you can't just
avoid me forever.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.557
We live on
the same street.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.259
Mm.

14:54.261 --> 14:58.029
Well, then...
I know what I have to do.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.864
Good-bye, Lois.

Oh, sour cream.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.843
Sour cream.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.750
Mr. Quagmire, which box
do these beads go in?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.752
Let me smell 'em.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.453
They go in the big box.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.455
Quagmire, I can't
believe you're moving.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.225
Look, give it time--
this whole thing will blow over.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.726
No, it's too awkward.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.795
It's best for everyone
if I just leave.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.130
That's too bad.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.333
We never got to do
that "Joe-Quagmire" lunch.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.438
Well, that'll do it.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.074
Peter, Quagmire's
serious about this.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.143
You got to do something!

15:45.145 --> 15:46.544
You're right.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.745
Quagmire, wait!

15:47.747 --> 15:50.815
You almost left
without this!

15:56.056 --> 15:58.790
You want me to be the one

TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to<i> Dateline.</i>

16:08.134 --> 16:10.735
Our story tonight:
The guy you think did it?

16:10.737 --> 16:11.803
He did it.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.104
Now go to bed.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.906
Your grandkids
are coming tomorrow.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.512
I had a pretty good
egg dish last night.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.916
What? What-what am I supposed
to do with that information?

16:24.918 --> 16:27.452
Well, I don't know.
Maybe ask me for the recipe?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.420
Do you have it?
No.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.456
So what's going on
with you guys?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.124
Nothing much.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.593
See, this is where Quagmire
normally would have told

16:35.595 --> 16:37.628
one of his
outrageous sex stories.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.765
Aw, we don't need him.
I got a sex story for you.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.633
So I'm banging this chick,
and she's saying to me,

16:42.635 --> 16:44.635
"I'm worried that Chris won't
get into college."

16:44.637 --> 16:46.270
And then I says to her,

16:46.272 --> 16:47.972
"Yeah, that seems like
a legitimate concern."

16:47.974 --> 16:50.842
And then I lost my wood,
and so we just watched Colbert,

16:50.844 --> 16:53.711
and then I took a dump
completely nude.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.580
Who else but Peter?

16:57.217 --> 16:59.884
Peter, face it-- without
Quagmire, we're boring.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.619
Oh, come on,
that ain't true.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.222
Yes, it is. He had
all the fun ideas.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.891
Remember? He even
took me parasailing.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.329
This is awesome!
It's like I'm flying!

17:11.331 --> 17:12.897
(whooping)

17:12.899 --> 17:15.633
I've never felt so alive!

17:15.635 --> 17:18.903
Oh, if only
I had a pair of legs.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.573
All right!

17:22.575 --> 17:25.209
(munching loudly)

17:25.211 --> 17:28.112
It was the fish part of me
that wanted 'em!

17:32.852 --> 17:34.352
(sighs)

17:34.354 --> 17:36.921
Look, Peter, I'm sorry
Quagmire moved away,

17:36.923 --> 17:39.891
but you can't just sit around
the house and drink all day.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.226
It's all your fault
Quagmire fell in love with you.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.362
Traipsin' around
in your tan pants

17:44.364 --> 17:46.931
and your green shirt
and your soothing voice.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.533
My fault?!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.268
Yeah, everything is messed up.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.904
I lost my best friend,
my buddies are all fighting,

17:52.906 --> 17:55.440
that chick at work is saying
stuff that ain't true.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.908
Okay, you know what?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.409
Enough feeling
sorry for yourself.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.545
We're fixing this now.
Get in the car.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.380
What? Why?
You'll see.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.382
Why should I trust you?

18:04.384 --> 18:06.951
You're always tricking me into
going places I don't want to.

18:06.953 --> 18:10.855
Oh. You said we were going
to a place Walt Disney built.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.357
No, Peter.
I said "supported."

18:13.359 --> 18:15.426
(bright fanfare playing,
fireworks whistling)

18:18.598 --> 18:21.299
LOIS:<i> By the way,</i>
<i>don't go on the train ride.</i>

18:25.805 --> 18:27.738
I've been playing
a game I invented

18:27.740 --> 18:30.441
called "mini racquetball"
in your garage.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.610
Uh-huh.
It's pretty fun.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.445
He has not won
a single point.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.781
You don't have to win
to have fun.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.049
(knocking on door)

18:40.053 --> 18:41.085
Lois?

18:41.087 --> 18:42.920
Peter. Zod.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.656
Hey. You're parked behind
my trapezoid-thing.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.825
Yeah, yeah,
I'll move it in a sec.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.628
Glenn, all this nonsense
has to stop now.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.930
The only reason
this became an issue is because

18:52.932 --> 18:54.966
Peter heard something
he wasn't supposed to hear.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.801
CLEVELAND:
Guy from<i> Superman</i> lives here?!

18:56.803 --> 18:59.003
And the truth is,
we all have private thoughts

18:59.005 --> 19:02.006
we don't act on,
and that's okay.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.142
For instance, every time
I'm on the subway,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.310
I want to push a stranger
onto the tracks.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.345
And that's fine!

19:07.347 --> 19:08.946
I don't do it!

19:08.948 --> 19:10.748
I guess you're right.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.117
I don't<i> totally</i> disagree with
what Kim Jong-un's doing,

19:13.119 --> 19:14.952
but you don't see
me moving there.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.921
I take medicine
I get from the veterinarian.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.322
Is that one?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.258
No, no, it's not,
but the point is,

19:20.260 --> 19:22.193
we all have secret thoughts.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.795
But there's no reason they
should ruin our friendships.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.764
Sometimes I think about
going to the hospital

19:26.766 --> 19:28.332
and switching
the babies around.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.134
Somali pirates
seem cool, too.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.470
I wouldn't mind eating
the Phillie Phanatic.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.439
See? We're all
terrible people inside.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.642
Joe's a little worse
than the rest of us,

19:37.644 --> 19:40.545
but we all just shove
our thoughts deep down

19:40.547 --> 19:42.146
where they can't
hurt anybody.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.682
Huh, maybe you're right.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.450
Of course I'm right.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.287
The secret to happiness is
burying all your true feelings

19:49.289 --> 19:52.156
and living a life
of bland compromise.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.525
So here's the question, Glenn.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.396
Do you love Peter enough
to repress your love for me?

20:02.402 --> 20:05.670
Peter, if you're willing
to forget all about this,

20:05.672 --> 20:09.307
I'm more than happy to continue
hiding my true feelings.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.409
I do miss us
hanging out together.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.078
Huh. Sorry I kind of
went a little crazy.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.214
Ah, that's all right.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.683
And I'm sorry
I will always love your wife.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.151
Which I don't.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.586
Thank you, Glenn.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.687
All right!

20:22.689 --> 20:24.055
What do you say
we all celebrate

20:24.057 --> 20:26.424
with a game
of mini racquetball?

20:26.426 --> 20:29.860
Wait. Is mini racquetball
just Ping-Pong?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.629
Kind of.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.868
Boy, it's good to have
the gang together again.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.704
Yeah, welcome home, buddy.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.173
Man, I missed sitting around,
just shooting the breeze.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.175
Hey, so how'd you get
your house back?

20:44.177 --> 20:45.676
This ought to be good.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.111
I suspended escrow.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.446
Oh.

20:49.682 --> 20:53.050
Hey, guys, you know that egg
dish I was talking about?

20:53.052 --> 20:55.786
Turns out that was
just a dream I had.
