TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

00:34.159 --> 00:35.459
<i>Stand-Up Specials</i>
<i>from Comedians</i>

00:35.461 --> 00:36.660
<i>You've Been Told to Like.</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:39.196
Please welcome Aziz Ansari!

00:39.198 --> 00:40.364
What's up, y'all?

00:40.366 --> 00:43.133
Sometimes I start a sentence
really soft

00:43.135 --> 00:46.003
and then get<i> loud!</i>

00:46.005 --> 00:47.838
(laughs)
He's hilarious

00:47.840 --> 00:49.272
'cause I saw him
in a other show.

00:49.274 --> 00:50.540
What are you
talking about?

00:50.542 --> 00:51.775
How is that funny?

00:51.777 --> 00:53.010
He didn't even
tell any jokes.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.378
Uh, if he didn't tell jokes,

00:54.380 --> 00:56.013
why was he laughing?

00:56.015 --> 00:58.281
Well, that's about as much HBO
as we're gonna get

00:58.283 --> 00:59.983
before they play
something homosexual.

00:59.985 --> 01:01.618
Come on, Chris.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.054
God, that's what passes
for comedy these days?

01:04.056 --> 01:06.356
What ever happened to
our venerated humorists?

01:06.358 --> 01:07.357
Here we go.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.192
Samuel Clemens,
Mark Twain.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.193
Same guy.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.878
Huck Finn.
Not a guy.

01:11.879 --> 01:13.562
Look, the point is,
I could do stand-up comedy.

01:13.565 --> 01:15.165
All I'd need is a newspaper

01:15.167 --> 01:18.035
and this twisted mind.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.404
Why waste your time
with stand-up, grandpa?

01:20.406 --> 01:22.572
All the best comedy
is on Twitter now.

01:22.574 --> 01:23.640
Really?
Yeah.

01:23.642 --> 01:25.876
Stand-up is so
20 years ago.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.044
Twitter's only
three years ago.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.211
Check mine out.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.714
I've got 10,000
followers.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.249
"I feel like we
should wait to hear

01:32.251 --> 01:34.084
"Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs

01:34.086 --> 01:35.886
before we choose sides."

01:35.888 --> 01:37.020
Who's Adele?

01:37.022 --> 01:38.021
Just keep reading.

01:38.023 --> 01:39.189
"Hey, short guys,

01:39.191 --> 01:41.591
"the more muscular you get,
the shorter you look.

01:41.593 --> 01:43.226
Did you not know that?"

01:43.228 --> 01:44.327
Well, that one
seems a little mean.

01:44.329 --> 01:46.063
Just give me the phone.
No, no.

01:46.065 --> 01:49.166
"I was wondering why this
tampon commercial was so long

01:49.168 --> 01:51.935
until I realized it was

01:51.937 --> 01:53.737
Was it a re-run
on basic cable,

01:53.739 --> 01:55.205
because sometimes
they edit those a lot

01:55.207 --> 01:56.840
and that could be
why you were confused?

01:56.842 --> 01:58.275
Hmm, that's
interesting, Brian.

01:58.277 --> 02:00.410
A girl in Iowa asked me
the same question.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.611
You know what I did?

02:01.613 --> 02:02.746
I flew her out here

02:02.748 --> 02:04.047
and (bleep) (bleep) her
in the face.

02:04.049 --> 02:05.115
So, yeah...

02:05.117 --> 02:06.249
Twitter.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.851
Look, those are
cute blurbs, Stewie,

02:07.853 --> 02:09.119
but I-I think I'm
gonna put together

02:09.121 --> 02:11.354
a real act
for real people.

02:11.356 --> 02:12.756
(scoffs)
Good luck.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.858
God, it's like
I'm the only person in the house

02:14.860 --> 02:16.760
who gets social media.

02:26.305 --> 02:28.538
LOIS:
That'll get it started.

02:32.244 --> 02:34.077
Where the
hell's Peter?

02:34.079 --> 02:35.245
I'm almost done doing

02:35.247 --> 02:36.446
the 45 minutes of stuff

02:36.448 --> 02:37.447
a woman my age

02:37.449 --> 02:39.282
needs to do
right before bed.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.284
I can't even remember

02:41.286 --> 02:43.887
why I sleep
in this belt anymore.

02:43.889 --> 02:45.722
(slurring): Hey, Chris,
don't tell your mom

02:45.724 --> 02:47.390
I threw up
in the Crock-Pot.

02:47.392 --> 02:48.558
Peter, it's me.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.559
Oh.

02:49.561 --> 02:50.660
Uh, I'll be right back.

02:50.662 --> 02:52.596
I gotta go tell Chris
somethin' gross.

02:52.598 --> 02:54.097
Just come to bed.

02:54.099 --> 02:55.132
All right, fine,

02:55.134 --> 02:56.600
but I'm not gonna
brush my teeth

02:56.602 --> 02:59.236
and I'm gonna
fart super hot.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.405
Get up.

03:02.407 --> 03:04.141
You're on my side
of the bed.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.809
Peter!

03:05.810 --> 03:07.476
We act like we didn't take
a lot from<i> The Simpsons,</i>

03:07.479 --> 03:10.280
but we took a lot
from<i> The Simpsons.</i>

03:10.282 --> 03:12.349
Damn it.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.954
Oh, my God, what happened
to your side of the bed?

03:17.956 --> 03:19.523
These springs are shot.

03:19.525 --> 03:21.124
And it's all damp
over here!

03:21.126 --> 03:22.993
Are... are these
mushrooms?

03:22.995 --> 03:25.162
That's where Smurfs is.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.197
Er, are. Uh...

03:27.199 --> 03:29.065
Smurves.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.309
Uh, hey, who handles
multimedia here?

03:39.311 --> 03:41.311
Because, uh, I have a slide
of the Capitol building

03:41.313 --> 03:43.180
that I'd like
projected behind me.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.815
And, yes, it is supposed
to be upside-down.

03:45.817 --> 03:47.184
You a comic?

03:47.186 --> 03:48.985
Satirist, yes.

03:48.987 --> 03:52.556
(Spanish accent):
What is with all the bad
cleaning supplies, am I right?

03:52.558 --> 03:54.724
I mean, Mr. Clean?

03:54.726 --> 03:57.961
More like Mr. Hard-to-Clean.

03:57.963 --> 03:59.329
Fantastik?

03:59.331 --> 04:00.997
More like terrible.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.365
Windex?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.367
More like Lose-Dex.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.735
MAN:
Get off the stage!

04:05.737 --> 04:08.471
No, no, no.

04:08.473 --> 04:10.240
(H. Jon Benjamin's voice):
All right, you guys
like impressions?

04:10.242 --> 04:12.542
Here's that guy Bob
from<i> Bob's Burgers.</i>

04:12.544 --> 04:15.378
Hi, I'm Bob from<i> Bob's Burgers.</i>

04:15.380 --> 04:16.846
How 'bout that show<i> Archer?</i>

04:16.848 --> 04:18.215
You watch that show<i> Archer?</i>

04:18.217 --> 04:19.649
Here's that guy Archer.

04:19.651 --> 04:22.252
Hi, I'm Archer,
from that show<i> Archer.</i>

04:22.254 --> 04:23.653
Now, what if those guys met?

04:23.655 --> 04:25.589
"Hey, Archer, it's Bob."

04:25.591 --> 04:28.191
"Hey, Bob, it's Archer."

04:28.193 --> 04:29.359
Thank you.

04:29.361 --> 04:32.562
Next up, let's keep it going
for Brian Griffin.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.763
(applause)

04:33.765 --> 04:34.998
All right, thanks.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.600
Hey, sorry I was late
getting here tonight,

04:36.602 --> 04:38.101
I was caught in gridlock.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.103
And then I left Congress.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.105
(silence)

04:42.107 --> 04:43.506
There was...
there was supposed to be

04:43.508 --> 04:46.576
an upside-down picture
of the Capitol behind me.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.911
Boy, awfully quiet in here.

04:47.913 --> 04:51.514
Sounds like John Boehner
talking about poverty.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.051
Whoosh.

04:55.053 --> 04:56.286
(chuckles)

04:58.290 --> 04:59.923
Hey, so, um...

04:59.925 --> 05:01.458
you know, maybe it's me,

05:01.460 --> 05:02.892
but I kind of feel like
we should wait

05:02.894 --> 05:04.527
to hear Adele's
ex-boyfriend's songs

05:04.529 --> 05:06.463
before we choose sides.

05:06.465 --> 05:09.266
(laughing, cheering)

05:09.268 --> 05:11.134
Yeah, and... and...
and hey, short guys,

05:11.136 --> 05:13.536
the more muscular you get,
the shorter you look.

05:13.538 --> 05:14.804
Did you not know that?

05:14.806 --> 05:17.274
(audience laughing)

05:17.276 --> 05:18.408
Wow.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.477
This is easier than getting
your Jet Ski license.

05:20.479 --> 05:22.245
All right, Kyle,
lookin' good.

05:22.247 --> 05:24.247
You got 100% on
your written test,

05:24.249 --> 05:25.315
100% on your
water test.

05:25.317 --> 05:26.950
Just one last question.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.286
Have you ever had a fistfight
with your stepdad?

05:29.288 --> 05:30.387
Which stepdad?

05:30.389 --> 05:31.388
You passed!

05:31.390 --> 05:32.389
Here's your license.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.790
Go be a dick.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.498
Oh, Lois, I slept great
on your side of the bed.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.166
Oh, and I read your journal.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.502
Boy, you really hate
"P-period G-period."

05:45.504 --> 05:47.437
Peter, our mattress
is a disaster.

05:47.439 --> 05:49.072
We're buying
a new one today.

05:49.074 --> 05:50.307
Does that mean
I can skip work?

05:50.309 --> 05:53.743
Well, it's 2:45,
so I guess yes.

05:53.745 --> 05:55.078
Hey.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.513
So, how'd it go
last night?

05:56.515 --> 05:57.647
Well, let's just say

05:57.649 --> 05:59.082
I got asked
to come back tonight.

05:59.084 --> 06:00.116
You're kidding.

06:00.118 --> 06:01.318
It actually
went over well?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.485
I figured
you'd be terrible.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.653
Why would you think that?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.488
Well, I know a thing
or two about performing.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.525
I mean, after all, I was
Vin Diesel's acting coach.

06:08.527 --> 06:10.427
Okay, Vin, I like
what you're doing there,

06:10.429 --> 06:12.996
but I want you to try it
one more time, like this:

06:12.998 --> 06:15.265
"Duh!"

06:18.870 --> 06:21.504
Look around, and let me know
if you have any questions.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.406
Oh, I have one.

06:23.407 --> 06:25.307
What percentage of
Hayden Panettiere is dwarf?

06:25.310 --> 06:26.810
Well, you're
the expert.

06:26.812 --> 06:28.478
What kind of mattress
do you have?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.380
Currently, I'm staying
with a friend,

06:30.382 --> 06:32.182
on an air mattress
in his laundry room.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.183
It's temporary.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.551
No, it's not.
No.

06:34.553 --> 06:36.386
Okay, well, thanks,
we'll just try a few out.

06:36.388 --> 06:38.355
I hope you don't mind,
I brought my CPAP machine.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.131
Also, I like to eat
a big bowl of berries

06:48.133 --> 06:49.399
before I go to sleep.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.148
Well, what do
you think, Peter?

07:05.150 --> 07:06.750
Well, it seems good,
but I won't know for sure

07:06.752 --> 07:08.551
until I have
my evening tug.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.186
I think we
like this one.

07:10.188 --> 07:11.421
W-What's it called?

07:11.423 --> 07:12.989
Deep Slumber 3000.

07:12.991 --> 07:14.724
You're buying it on Amazon,
aren't you?

07:14.726 --> 07:16.659
Yup.
They have drones now.

07:16.661 --> 07:19.162
(drone whirring)

07:19.164 --> 07:20.363
Oh, come on, Peter,

07:20.365 --> 07:22.932
we gotta beat the
drone to the house!

07:22.934 --> 07:24.567
Real stores suck!

07:29.608 --> 07:32.575
So I was wondering why this
tampon commercial was so long,

07:32.577 --> 07:35.078
until I realized it was
a re-run of<i> Sex and the City.</i>

07:35.080 --> 07:37.080
(laughter)

07:37.082 --> 07:39.082
Okay, you guys have been great.
Good night.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.483
(applause)

07:42.387 --> 07:44.587
Funny stuff.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.589
Hey, uh...
Stewie!

07:46.591 --> 07:48.458
You, uh, you
caught the show?

07:48.460 --> 07:49.759
You bloody thief!

07:49.761 --> 07:52.395
Every joke you told up there
was stolen from me!

07:52.397 --> 07:53.763
Stewie, relax.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.398
You know what?
That's it!

07:55.400 --> 07:57.200
You and I are
no longer friends!

07:57.202 --> 07:59.636
(toilet flushes)

07:59.638 --> 08:01.571
WOMAN:
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

08:01.573 --> 08:04.474
Oh, it's
everywhere!

08:08.547 --> 08:10.079
Hey, Stewie,
you got a second?

08:10.081 --> 08:11.648
I have nothing to
say to you, Brian.

08:11.650 --> 08:14.083
Besides, I'm busy playing
with my new friend.

08:14.085 --> 08:15.385
What new friend?

08:17.823 --> 08:20.223
(electronic whirring, beeping)

08:20.225 --> 08:22.992
Is this dog
bothering you, Stewie?

08:22.994 --> 08:24.060
What the hell?

08:24.062 --> 08:25.428
You couldn't find
a real friend

08:25.430 --> 08:26.496
so you built a robot?

08:26.498 --> 08:28.131
Oh, not a robot, Brian.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.467
He's a human mind model
adaptive super computer.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.236
I've even programmed him
to learn and grow smarter.

08:33.238 --> 08:34.471
His name is Lyle.

08:34.473 --> 08:35.905
Stewie, perhaps
we should offer

08:35.907 --> 08:37.307
this guest
a beverage.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.008
Or simply lift
the toilet seat.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.478
Ooh! Snap, Brian!

08:41.480 --> 08:43.146
(tinny version of "Gloria"
by Laura Branigan playing)

08:43.148 --> 08:44.314
♪ Gloria ♪

08:44.316 --> 08:45.348
What the hell's
going on?

08:45.350 --> 08:46.649
What's going on?

08:46.651 --> 08:47.817
You've been "Lyle'd"!

08:47.819 --> 08:49.519
♪ Gloria ♪

08:49.521 --> 08:51.087
♪ I think they got
the alias... ♪

08:56.828 --> 08:58.828

08:58.830 --> 09:01.331
♪ ♪

09:01.333 --> 09:02.699
(song ends)
Wow.

09:02.701 --> 09:04.167
Didn't know we'd have
to hear the whole song.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.502
You built a robot?

09:05.504 --> 09:07.036
This is pathetic,
Stewie.

09:07.038 --> 09:08.538
You really must be
desperate for friends.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.973
Oh,<i> I'm</i> desperate?

09:09.975 --> 09:12.575
Lyle, access
Brian's phone.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.646
Look at that,
you only have four contacts.

09:16.648 --> 09:18.681
And... oh, my God,

09:18.683 --> 09:20.683
you downloaded
the Dunkin' Donuts app?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.852
And who Shazams the Beatles?

09:22.854 --> 09:23.853
Whatever.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.288
Have fun with
your little robot.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.156
But if you ask me, this whole
thing is more disturbing

09:27.158 --> 09:28.958
than a dump
after a beet salad.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.959
(man screams)

09:29.961 --> 09:31.628
Oh, right.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.567
Okay, Lois, I dabbed
some toothpaste

09:37.569 --> 09:39.369
on the inside
of my nose, so...

09:39.371 --> 09:41.671
I am willing to take
the old "Nestea plunge,"

09:41.673 --> 09:43.206
if you know
what I mean.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.507
I guess what
I'm saying is,

09:44.509 --> 09:46.376
time to break in
the new mattress, eh?

09:46.378 --> 09:47.744
Peter, it's brand-new.

09:47.746 --> 09:49.145
I don't want
to mess it up.

09:49.147 --> 09:50.713
Come on, we won't
make a mess.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.715
When we're done,
I'll grab you by the ankles

09:52.717 --> 09:54.684
and lift you up
like a dirty garbage bag.

09:54.686 --> 09:55.752
No!

09:55.754 --> 09:57.153
This mattress
was expensive,

09:57.155 --> 09:58.922
and I'd like to keep it nice
for a little while.

09:58.924 --> 10:00.757
Are you serious?
We can't do it?

10:00.759 --> 10:02.759
For how long?
I don't know.

10:02.761 --> 10:04.594
L-Let's just keep it new
for a few weeks.

10:04.596 --> 10:05.728
A few weeks?!

10:05.730 --> 10:06.696
Come on, you know
I'm terrible

10:06.698 --> 10:08.197
at waiting for things.

10:08.199 --> 10:10.900
We'll be right back with more
<i>Laverne & Shirley.</i>

10:10.902 --> 10:12.669
But I want it now!

10:19.778 --> 10:22.111
All right, Lyle, one thing
buddies do together

10:22.113 --> 10:24.681
is go to the movies and
talk about it afterwards.

10:52.143 --> 10:53.576
I'm going to bed.

10:53.578 --> 10:55.211
Yeah.

10:56.715 --> 10:58.881
Oh, Lyle, I'm so glad
I have you as a friend.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.783
Now I can do fun things

11:00.785 --> 11:02.385
like get on your shoulders
and wear a trench coat

11:02.387 --> 11:04.520
and be tall enough
to ride roller coasters.

11:08.159 --> 11:09.759
Hello, fellow adult.

11:09.761 --> 11:12.161
I am clearly above
the minimum height requirement

11:12.163 --> 11:13.763
and shall now ride
your roller coaster,

11:13.765 --> 11:15.598
for which you are an attendant.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.767
Yes, and I will operate
this roller coaster,

11:17.769 --> 11:20.236
as I am an adult who
is licensed to do so.

11:21.072 --> 11:22.305
Hey!

11:22.307 --> 11:23.606
Oh, no!

11:23.608 --> 11:24.607
It's the manager.

11:24.609 --> 11:25.775
Run!

11:25.777 --> 11:28.177
You get out of here,
you kids who are just kids

11:28.179 --> 11:30.246
and not an adult like me!

11:40.091 --> 11:43.092
I do so enjoy
our time together, Lyle.

11:43.094 --> 11:45.094
In fact, I drew you
a little keepsake.

11:45.096 --> 11:48.498
It's a picture of a mailman
wearing a cowboy hat.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.666
Just a silly thing.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.667
Thank you, Stewie.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.669
I drew you
something as well.

11:52.671 --> 11:56.005
It's an urban plan for a
workable Palestinian state.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.541
My word, this is
very impressive.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.209
The credit is yours, Stewie.

12:00.211 --> 12:03.513
It was you who programmed me
to grow exponentially smarter.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.681
Ah, I suppose
you're right.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.517
As Kahlil Gilbane wrote
in<i> The Prophet,</i>

12:07.519 --> 12:10.687
"I am the bow from which
the arrow of you was launched."

12:10.689 --> 12:12.689
It is Kahlil<i> Gibran.</i>

12:12.691 --> 12:15.124
"Gilbane" is a construction
company in Providence.

12:15.126 --> 12:18.528
Ah, yes, I see... I see
the-the name on the trucks.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.530
So it's ea... um,
easy mix up there.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.533
In any case, Lyle, I'm very
proud of you and your progress.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.535
You, my friend, are
the greatest invention

12:25.537 --> 12:27.437
since the Trapper Creeper.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.039
Ah...

12:30.041 --> 12:32.041
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.110
(imitates motorboat)

12:37.849 --> 12:39.682
Well, wouldn't
you know it,

12:39.684 --> 12:41.684
I moved the van over
to the other gas pump,

12:41.686 --> 12:43.853
and the gas cap was
still on the wrong side.

12:43.855 --> 12:45.688
(laughs)

12:45.690 --> 12:48.257
Boy, that was one trip to the
lake we're not gonna forget.

12:48.259 --> 12:49.926
Shut the hell up,
will you, Joe?

12:49.928 --> 12:51.928
Geez, what's your
problem, Peter?

12:51.930 --> 12:54.931
I-I'm sorry, guys, I guess
I'm just a little on edge.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.733
I'm not getting any
from Lois.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.901
Is it 'cause Lois is
going through the change?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.837
Donna's getting
a tiny mustache.

13:00.839 --> 13:03.840
I told her it felt like I
was kissing Ernie Hudson.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.408
That turned out
to be a mistake.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.009
No, no, it's 'cause we got
this new mattress,

13:07.011 --> 13:08.945
and Lois doesn't want
to mess it up.

13:08.947 --> 13:10.546
What kind of mattress
did you get?

13:10.548 --> 13:12.548
I hope you did your homework,
because you're gonna spend

13:12.550 --> 13:14.550
a third of your
life on that thing.

13:14.552 --> 13:16.352
I swear to God, Joe...

13:16.354 --> 13:17.920
Look, Peter, the
answer is obvious.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.756
If Lois won't sleep with
you on the new mattress,

13:19.758 --> 13:21.357
we just got to get
your old mattress back.

13:21.359 --> 13:23.760
Oh, my God, Quagmire,
that's a great idea.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.862
She won't care about messing up
the old mattress.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.029
But you already
got rid of it.

13:27.031 --> 13:28.431
You'll never
find that thing.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.032
Well, we're just
gonna have to.

13:30.034 --> 13:31.868
Man, I haven't been this
desperate to find something

13:31.870 --> 13:34.137
since Meg was kidnapped
by that maniac.

13:34.139 --> 13:36.806
It puts the lotion
on its skin.

13:38.576 --> 13:40.576
(door opens)

13:40.578 --> 13:42.145
Oh, Meg, thank
God I found you.

13:42.147 --> 13:43.579
Hey, remember
how you borrowed

13:43.581 --> 13:44.981
my club card for
the grocery store?

13:44.983 --> 13:46.582
Could you toss
that up to me?

13:46.584 --> 13:48.985
Oh, you don't have
to have the card.

13:48.987 --> 13:50.987
You can just give them
your phone number.

13:50.989 --> 13:51.988
Oh, really?

13:51.990 --> 13:53.156
Hey, thanks, man.

13:53.158 --> 13:54.991
Hey, Meg, I like
your new boyfriend.

13:54.993 --> 13:56.592
Every pot finds
a lid, huh?

13:56.594 --> 13:58.594
(chuckles)
Have fun, you kids.

13:58.596 --> 14:00.830
(door closes)

14:03.935 --> 14:06.969
Lyle, we finally got
a thank you note from Bella

14:06.971 --> 14:07.970
for that birthday party present.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.138
With a single mom,

14:09.140 --> 14:10.973
I didn't know for sure
if it was coming, but...

14:10.975 --> 14:12.141
What... what's
going on here?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.576
Hello, Stewie.

14:13.578 --> 14:14.977
I've built a few friends
for myself.

14:14.979 --> 14:15.978
You have?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.413
I'm sorry,

14:17.415 --> 14:18.981
but I've outpaced
your intelligence.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.984
I needed to create some friends
who are my cognitive peers.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.821
Meet Ted R. and Ted P.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.823
Are they doing math
on glass?!

14:26.825 --> 14:29.826
And invading each other's
personal space?

14:29.828 --> 14:31.828
That means they have
Asperger's,

14:31.830 --> 14:33.930
the smartest mental
impairment there is.

14:33.932 --> 14:36.499
Stewie, I'm afraid I
no longer have time

14:36.501 --> 14:38.501
for a friend of
your simple ways.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.102
I must ask you to leave.

14:40.104 --> 14:42.939
No, he must Asperger
you to leave.

14:42.941 --> 14:45.107
Ho-ho. You've
been "Ted R.'d."

14:45.109 --> 14:48.110
(Ricky Martin's
"The Cup of Life" plays)

14:48.112 --> 14:49.946
That was mean.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.113
But I like that song.

14:51.115 --> 14:52.515
Is he sad?

14:52.517 --> 14:54.450
I can't tell
if he's sad.

15:05.063 --> 15:07.463
Finally, Stewie's
back from the store.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.866
Yes, I'm sorry it
took me so long.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.301
But I got the garlic blue cheese
salad dressing you wanted.

15:12.303 --> 15:13.870
Does that mean I'm
in the crew now?

15:13.872 --> 15:17.340
It does if you drink
the whole bottle while we watch.

15:17.342 --> 15:19.408
Um, okay.

15:20.645 --> 15:22.912
(gulping)

15:22.914 --> 15:23.913
Oh...

15:23.915 --> 15:24.914
Oh, my God.

15:24.916 --> 15:26.749
It's so salty.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.751
(gulping)

15:28.753 --> 15:31.354
Oh, and chunky right when
you don't want it to be.

15:31.356 --> 15:33.356
(gulping)

15:33.358 --> 15:34.757
(gasping)

15:34.759 --> 15:35.925
There, I did it.

15:35.927 --> 15:36.926
We're friends
now, right?

15:36.928 --> 15:38.361
Maybe.

15:38.363 --> 15:40.763
How about you throw it all up
back into the bottle?

15:40.765 --> 15:42.498
But don't spill a drop.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.066
Okay, okay.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.568
Okay, I can do that.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.905
Oh, I'm sorry!

15:48.907 --> 15:50.506
I'm sorry, I forgot
to purse my lips.

15:50.508 --> 15:53.075
I'll go get another
bottle and try again.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.144
(crying, retching)

15:56.681 --> 15:59.749
I bet the mall
around here sucks.

16:03.388 --> 16:04.954
Peter, what are we
doing here?

16:04.956 --> 16:06.956
I thought we were looking
for your mattress.

16:06.958 --> 16:09.959
We are, this is a
1950s insane asylum.

16:09.961 --> 16:12.795
They use old mattresses to
pad the walls of the cells.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.030
(doorbell chimes)

16:14.032 --> 16:16.098
May I help you?

16:16.100 --> 16:19.101
Yes, 1950s doctor, me and
my friends are looking for...

16:19.103 --> 16:21.270
You're friends with a
Negro and a cripple?

16:21.272 --> 16:22.705
This man is insane.

16:22.707 --> 16:23.940
Take him away.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.610
Now wait a second,
you can't do that to...

16:27.612 --> 16:30.212
A Negro speaking up
to a white person?

16:30.214 --> 16:31.681
This man is insane.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.051
Now look,
I don't think...

16:35.053 --> 16:36.619
All cripples
are insane.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.120
Euthanize this man.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.724
Something I can
help<i> you</i> with?

16:41.726 --> 16:43.292
Yeah, you got any
brain-dead women in there

16:43.294 --> 16:45.127
you let people have sex with
for a few bucks?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.796
Sure, come on back.

16:50.735 --> 16:52.301
Well, Peter, I don't think
you can go any farther

16:52.303 --> 16:54.136
down the ladder
than porno people.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.238
So if your mattress isn't
here, I'm afraid it's gone.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.640
Hey, I bet that's it.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.076
Get up, lady,
that's my mattress.

17:00.078 --> 17:02.144
Oh, my God, Bruce,
you do porn?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.746
Nah, I's part
of the crew.

17:03.748 --> 17:06.148
I mostly just powder
the ding-dongs.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.750
This ain't your
mattress, buddy.

17:07.752 --> 17:10.319
We just got it, fresh off
the boat from Eastern Europe.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.155
(female Eastern European
accent): I was told I would
have job as au pair.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.157
Instead I am just bang slab.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.325
Ah, damn it.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.160
We did get another
one yesterday,

17:18.162 --> 17:20.162
but some fat-ass blew
out half the springs,

17:20.164 --> 17:22.164
so we put lunch on it.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.167
(gasps)
My mattress.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.168
Hey, we found it.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.603
All right, let's get her
out of here.

17:27.605 --> 17:30.606
I got to tell you guys,
I am so happy we found this.

17:30.608 --> 17:33.442
It's like when I found
my thrill on Blueberry Hill.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.012
That's it?

17:36.014 --> 17:38.014
It's just a bunch
of blueberries?

17:38.016 --> 17:39.849
Ah, two dogs humping.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.451
Ah, this was worth
the four-hour flight.

17:50.061 --> 17:51.227
Oh, my God, Stewie.

17:51.229 --> 17:53.462
What are you doing in the toilet
with the lid closed?

17:53.464 --> 17:57.066
Ted R. says this is where
a piece of crap has to live.

17:57.068 --> 17:58.067
This is terrible.

17:58.069 --> 18:00.069
Those robots are not
your friends.

18:00.071 --> 18:02.805
Yeah, well, at least they
don't steal from me.

18:02.807 --> 18:05.808
Look, I'm really sorry
I stole your jokes.

18:05.810 --> 18:07.376
It was a rotten
thing to do.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.211
You may not want me
back as a friend,

18:09.213 --> 18:11.213
but you deserve better
than those robots.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.816
Of course I want
you back, Brian.

18:13.818 --> 18:16.385
The fact is-- I miss
hanging out with you.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.387
I'll tell you what,
let's hang out tonight

18:18.389 --> 18:21.223
after they see how many slaps
it takes to give me a stutter.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.825
Stewie, you got to put
a stop to this.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.827
I mean, you made them--
you can destroy them.

18:24.829 --> 18:27.930
What do you say you and I,
we take these robots out?

18:27.932 --> 18:30.499
You'd... you'd help me do that?

18:30.501 --> 18:32.701
Of course, Stewie,
I'm your friend.

18:32.703 --> 18:34.703
All right,
let's do it.

18:34.705 --> 18:36.272
Thank you, Brian.

18:36.274 --> 18:37.706
Okay, let's wrap it up.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.275
I reserved this time

18:39.277 --> 18:41.710
to listen to Metallica
and flex in the mirror.

18:41.712 --> 18:43.946
He's right; it's
on the whiteboard.

18:47.285 --> 18:50.119
Peter, what is that?

18:50.121 --> 18:52.721
This, Lois, is
our old mattress.

18:52.723 --> 18:54.123
Well, get it out of here.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.725
It smells like
John Popper's cargo shorts.

18:56.727 --> 18:59.095
No, it smells
like our marriage.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.229
What?!

19:00.231 --> 19:01.630
Don't you see, Lois?

19:01.632 --> 19:03.632
This mattress is
a living tapestry

19:03.634 --> 19:05.067
of everything we've
done together.

19:05.069 --> 19:06.635
Every stain, a story.

19:06.637 --> 19:09.071
Every smudge, a chapter
in our family's life.

19:09.073 --> 19:11.240
This mark here is from
where we conceived Meg.

19:11.242 --> 19:12.641
Over here was Chris.

19:12.643 --> 19:14.243
And all the way up
here was Stewie,

19:14.245 --> 19:16.712
'cause, remember, you coughed
up all that pool water?

19:16.714 --> 19:19.882
Oh, Peter,
you were so handsome.

19:19.884 --> 19:23.452
Lois, this mattress may be old
and worn-in, but so are we.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.856
And I wouldn't trade
you in for anything.

19:30.895 --> 19:32.461
You know, I, uh, think

19:32.463 --> 19:35.297
I still got a stain
or two left inside me.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.133
(giggling):
Oh, Peter.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.904
PETER: Yeah, I want to do you
right where the porn lunch was.

19:41.906 --> 19:43.472
LOIS:
What?

19:43.474 --> 19:45.908
PETER: I said, I want to do you
right where the porn lunch was.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.743
God, I wish you'd listen.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.252
Stewie, three more
Arnold Palmers.

19:56.254 --> 19:58.420
Boy, we're destroying them
at the right time, Brian.

19:58.422 --> 20:00.823
I don't have enough iced
tea for the correct ratio.

20:00.825 --> 20:01.824
It'll be too lemonade-y.

20:01.826 --> 20:02.825
They'll be furious.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.260
All right,
so let's do it.

20:04.262 --> 20:05.494
Let's take 'em out.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.329
I'll warn you,
it's not gonna be easy.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.497
They're incredibly intelligent

20:08.499 --> 20:09.932
and getting smarter
by the minute.

20:09.934 --> 20:11.934
I designed them to be
constantly adapting...

20:11.936 --> 20:13.502
It's done, I sprayed 'em
with the hose.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.005
(electrical crackling)

20:21.345 --> 20:23.345
Ah, boy, that was
the best night's sleep

20:23.347 --> 20:24.947
I've had
in a long time, Lois.

20:24.949 --> 20:26.515
Same with me.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.517
You know, I'm glad we're
keeping our old mattress.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.519
Sometimes newer
isn't better.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.521
Yeah.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.356
Are your privates itchy, too,
or just mine?

20:34.358 --> 20:35.524
No, they're itchy.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.959
Maybe we should keep
the new mattress.

20:36.961 --> 20:38.360
Way ahead of you, Lois.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.962
I already dragged
the old one out to the curb.

20:39.964 --> 20:43.032
Good. Okay, I'm gonna go rub up
against the basement doorjamb.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.368
Stewie, I really am sorry
about what happened.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.536
Oh, don't mention it.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.538
I'm just glad to have
the whole mess behind us.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.740
So what'd you end up doing
with those old robots anyway?

20:51.742 --> 20:53.809
I just left them out
on the curb for the trash man.

20:58.249 --> 21:00.416
How can this
not be a trap?
