00:36.303 --> 00:37.836
<i>but can't</i>

00:37.838 --> 00:40.005
<i>Then try new Vodka Beer.</i>

00:40.007 --> 00:41.640
<i>The can says "beer,"</i>

00:41.642 --> 00:44.643
<i>but inside is 12 ounces</i>

00:44.645 --> 00:47.579
<i>And the best part is,</i>
<i>your wife will never know.</i>

00:47.581 --> 00:49.248
Honey, I'm so proud of you,

00:49.250 --> 00:51.150
cutting down to one
beer a night.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.318
(slurring):
Take off your underwear.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.822
She don't know.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.157
I got the mail.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.359
Hey, does an octopus
live here?

01:00.361 --> 01:01.894
Peter, that says
"occupant."

01:01.896 --> 01:03.095
Oh, that's too bad.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.430
That would've
been awesome.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.098
Oh, look, Peter.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.666
Here's something from
your mother's estate.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.035
Oh, looks like they finally
sold her house.

01:10.037 --> 01:13.005
And the last white domino
in that neighborhood falls.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.173
Wow, they sold it?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.441
So that means the house

01:15.443 --> 01:16.909
and everything inside
of it is gone?

01:16.911 --> 01:18.510
Oh, sweetheart.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.846
You thinking about all the good
times you had there?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.048
No, I'm thinking about
my teenage porn stash.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.783
It's still hidden
in the house.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.953
Oh, okay, but I know this
is really about the memories.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.456
Lactating sluts
on box springs.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.724
The-The-The special times
growing up...

01:32.726 --> 01:34.693
Bikini black chicks
sneezing.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.029
Lois, stop making him
reminisce about stuff.

01:37.031 --> 01:38.397
You don't understand, Lois.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.798
A boy's first collection
of nudie books

01:39.800 --> 01:41.700
and girlie movies
is a sacred thing.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.368
It can't fall into
a stranger's hands.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.803
This is very serious.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.538
I'm taking us to DEFCON 4.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.873
(sign buzzes)

01:47.875 --> 01:49.908
What happens when
it hits DEFCON 1?

01:49.910 --> 01:52.144
We see a dog wearing a wig.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.146
Aw, heck, let's see that anyway.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.314
(Peter chuckles)

01:55.316 --> 01:58.450
<i>That's not even a lady dog.</i>

02:02.089 --> 02:04.323
Hey, Peter, what's wrong?
You've been real quiet.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.457
I don't know,
Quagmire.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.092
I keep thinking
of my old pornos.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.128
It's like I'm reminded
of them everywhere I look.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.263
You've been looking
at Cleveland a lot.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.599
Plus, you know, when
people find that box,

02:13.601 --> 02:15.734
they won't know that, like,
for some of them magazines,

02:15.736 --> 02:17.669
I just had them as,
like, a joke.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.471
You know, not 'cause, like,
I was really into it.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.606
Just the opposite.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.940
For some of them
magazines.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.142
Okay.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.843
I'm going to be
arrested for sure.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.645
Peter, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.813
You, Quagmire?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.515
You enjoy
pornography, too?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.650
Yup, and I know that
a man's porn collection

02:31.652 --> 02:33.952
must be secured and
protected at all costs,

02:33.954 --> 02:35.521
until he gets
ashamed of it

02:35.523 --> 02:37.256
and ditches it in an alley
behind a Kroger's.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.457
Hey, I know!

02:38.459 --> 02:40.192
What if we break into
my old house

02:40.194 --> 02:42.261
and steal back
my big box of pornos?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.929
What do you say?
You guys with me?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.197
You bet.
Sure thing, Peter.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.532
I mean, come on,
we're a team.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.700
Like fish and chips
and fat guys.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.702
I want the double cheeseburger,

02:50.704 --> 02:53.372
but I'm gonna go healthy
and get the fish and chips.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.773
ANNOUNCER :
<i>Fish and chips!</i>

02:54.775 --> 02:58.210
(singing jauntily):

02:58.212 --> 03:01.046
(crickets chirping)

03:01.048 --> 03:02.681
Okay, you all
remember the plan--

03:02.683 --> 03:04.950
we walk up wearing
our Bill Cosby masks...

03:04.952 --> 03:07.152
Peter, that's
President Obama.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.721
Oh, did I just
do a racism?

03:09.723 --> 03:10.889
(knocking on window)

03:10.891 --> 03:12.891
Hello? Can I help
you gentlemen?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.293
Hi.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.994
You guys have been sitting
in front of my house

03:15.996 --> 03:18.397
for the last five hours
trying on Obama masks.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.065
Is there something
I can do for you?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.234
We, uh... we-we were
just getting ready

03:22.236 --> 03:23.702
to break into your house.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.703
Excuse me?

03:24.705 --> 03:25.804
Oh, hey, cool shirt.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.573
What?
Oh, thank you.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.074
Look, what's this all about?

03:29.076 --> 03:30.742
This guy used to live
in your house

03:30.744 --> 03:32.477
and a box of his old porn
is still hidden in there.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.012
We were gonna break in
and take it.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.681
And I was gonna stay
with the rental van

03:35.683 --> 03:38.250
because it's my name
what's on the contract.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.586
Oh. Well, you could've just
knocked on the door and asked.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.254
I don't want that stuff,
I've got kids.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.388
Get it out of there!

03:43.390 --> 03:44.923
Really? Awesome!

03:44.925 --> 03:47.926
Oh, well that was easier
than a game of Pai Gow poker.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.428
Pai gow.
You lose again!

03:49.430 --> 03:50.996
That was awesome!

03:50.998 --> 03:52.764
I can't believe these tables
are always empty.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.533
You play again?
Nope, out of money.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.901
I'm just gonna wait
for my drink.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.603
Who had the full glass
of Goldschlager?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.204
Ah. Sorry, can't tip.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.607
I'm gonna take this
up to my room.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.410
Uhp, on the wrong floor.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.713
(vacuum whirring)

04:07.715 --> 04:10.449
Almost time for lunch.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.917
Ah...

04:11.919 --> 04:12.918
How was everything?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.186
Delicious.

04:14.188 --> 04:15.420
The prime rib
was mostly fat.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.855
Should I charge it
to your room?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.423
No, I had to check out,

04:18.425 --> 04:20.058
even though my
flight's not until midnight.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.962
Now, how does one with no money
get to the airport?

04:23.964 --> 04:27.232
(horn honking)

04:27.234 --> 04:31.103
(truck honking)

04:31.105 --> 04:34.473
(grunting)

04:34.475 --> 04:37.142
Hey, buddy, you're
blocking the outlet.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.378
Oh, sorry.
There was no chairs.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.617
Hi, Peter.
How was Vegas?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.020
Oh, it's the best.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.924
Sweet.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.727
Now, which movie
should I start with?

04:55.729 --> 04:57.929
<i>"Back-Door Sluts 4."</i>

04:57.931 --> 04:59.731
Eh, I haven't
seen the first three,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.233
I wouldn't know what's going on.

05:01.235 --> 05:03.168
Here we go.

05:04.571 --> 05:08.073
I want to watch
all of these movies, nonstop.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.244
I don't want to watch
any more of these movies, ever.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.814
Hey, Brian, you want to go for
a ride to behind the Kroger's?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.115
What?

05:17.117 --> 05:19.084
That's weird. What's that?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.859
Hello, Future Peter.
Hi.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.295
By the time you watch this,
you'll be a grown-up,

You know it.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.835
Also, I bet you're
a big important doctor

05:36.837 --> 05:40.005
like that Doogie Howser kid
who's getting so much ass.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.173
Well, I was partly right.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.474
I just hope to God

05:42.476 --> 05:43.975
you're not stuck
in some loser job,

05:43.977 --> 05:45.711
like in a brewery,
or a toy factory,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.946
or a fishing boat.
Oh, boy.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.048
But, you know, I don't have
to worry about none of that.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.451
I'm sure you're
a big, successful doctor.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.250
Yay!
My nose is finally a woman!

08:39.887 --> 08:43.555
Okay, so maybe he's a little
rough around the edges, but--

08:43.557 --> 08:46.057
Oh, boy, a little
got in my mouth there.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.459
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to wash this shirt.

08:47.461 --> 08:48.693
Anyway, I'm going
to help Chris

08:48.695 --> 08:50.395
become a big,
important success.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.632
The same way Mumford turned
his son into a success.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.567
Okay, Dad, heading out
to the concert.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.202
Now, hold on a minute, son.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.570
Where are your arm garters?

08:58.572 --> 09:00.405
Your string tie?
Your woolen vest?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.507
You look nothing like
a dry goods clerk

09:02.509 --> 09:04.075
from the Garfield
administration.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.143
But, Dad...

09:05.145 --> 09:06.645
No buts! You're a Mumford.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.812
Now get upstairs,

09:07.814 --> 09:09.247
put on a jaunty
travelling hat,

09:09.249 --> 09:12.284
and write the same song
25 times.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.389
Okay, now, Chris, if you
want to be a success,

09:17.391 --> 09:19.424
you gotta look worldly
and sophisticated.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.726
And to do that, you got
to dress like Lenny Kravitz,

09:21.728 --> 09:24.763
with little something from every
part of he world pinned on you.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.265
Leather bracelets!
Nipple ring!

09:27.267 --> 09:29.067
Zippers where zippers
shouldn't be!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.902
Wilma Flintstone
pearl necklaces!

09:30.904 --> 09:33.004
A fur shrug
with crocheted sleeves!

09:33.006 --> 09:34.172
A hat on a hat!

09:34.174 --> 09:35.707
A watch on your pinky toe!

09:35.709 --> 09:37.008
And nothing says,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.610
"Look at me, I've been places"

09:38.612 --> 09:41.179
like two lit road flares
hanging from your sunglasses.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.948
Hey, you look like
you've been places.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.082
Stop looking at me!

09:44.084 --> 09:47.118
I do not want
this attention!

09:47.120 --> 09:49.087
Come on, Chris,
let's get out of here.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.868
Uh, what are you doing?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.437
Well, I been trying
to make Chris

10:05.439 --> 10:07.539
less of a fat dummy,
and nothing seems to be working,

10:07.541 --> 10:09.975
so now we're high-stepping
around in giant hats.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.409
Tip of the giant hat, sir.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.978
And to you, sir!

10:12.980 --> 10:15.146
Yes, sir, smart day
to you, sir.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.448
And I thank you, sir.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.482
(yelps)

10:17.484 --> 10:19.150
(cries)

10:19.152 --> 10:22.153
I scraped my knee bad!

10:22.155 --> 10:23.955
Get up, Chris, you're
embarrassing yourself.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.457
You look stupid and fat.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.658
Peter, I have to ask--

10:26.660 --> 10:28.159
are you pushing
Chris so hard

10:28.161 --> 10:29.728
because it's what's
best for him?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.896
Or are you trying to make up
or your own disappointment

10:31.898 --> 10:33.331
about how your life
turned out?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.233
Brian, these are the biggest
hats I could find,

10:35.235 --> 10:37.469
so if your point is that there's
even larger ones available,

10:37.471 --> 10:39.337
I would greet that
with skepticism.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.006
No, no, no, my point is
that you need to let Chris

10:41.008 --> 10:42.507
find his own path.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.842
(gasps)

10:43.844 --> 10:45.310
Oh, my God,
you're right, Brian.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.278
He needs to be pointed
to a very specific path.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.247
And then forced to go down it.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.483
No, no, that's-that's the
opposite of what I just said.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.151
Chris, your best
chance for success

10:53.153 --> 10:55.286
is to be cultured and
worldly, like our dog.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.022
So starting right now,

10:57.024 --> 10:59.524
you gotta follow Brian around
and do everything he does.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.126
What?!
Come on, Brian.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.794
You gotta show Chris how
to turn out better than me.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.095
I mean, you went to Brown,

11:04.097 --> 11:05.764
you're a published author,

11:05.766 --> 11:07.866
you can hear it first when
Joe falls out of the tub.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.601
That's starting
to happen more often.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.036
But I guess you're right.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.604
Maybe I am the guy
to make a diamond

11:12.606 --> 11:14.005
out of this lump of coal.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.607
But only if
it's what Chris wants.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.608
I don't care.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.776
All right, I'll do it.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.377
Just follow
my lead, Chris.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.945
'Cause I think you
could be something great.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.213
Who knows?
Maybe you'll even become

11:22.215 --> 11:24.015
one of those mission
control leaders

11:24.017 --> 11:26.518
who gets all thoughtful
while everybody's celebrating.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.655
Apollo 13, this is Mission
Control, do you copy?

11:30.657 --> 11:34.859
Apollo 13, this is
Mission Control, do you copy?

11:34.861 --> 11:37.529
Do you copy, Apollo 13?

11:37.531 --> 11:38.963
(static hissing)

11:38.965 --> 11:41.332
Mission Control,
this is Apollo 13.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.235
We're all okay.
Good to be home.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.137
(cheering)

11:46.139 --> 11:47.706
(sighs)

11:50.744 --> 11:52.077
Sir, you did it!

11:52.079 --> 11:54.045
Sir, is everything okay?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.881
Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader
a couple of years ago

11:56.883 --> 11:59.584
and I'm still pissed about it.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.657
♪ ♪

12:13.266 --> 12:16.668
♪ ♪

12:31.418 --> 12:33.518

12:45.932 --> 12:50.001

Hey. Hey.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.918
Chew that way.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.254
Eh, dinner's no fun
without Chris here.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.322
There's nobody here for me
to wing my biscuit at.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.659
Well, Peter, he's been spending
an awful lot of time with Bri--

13:14.661 --> 13:16.995
Eh, it's not
the same.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.131
Anyway, he and Brian have been
spending a lot of time together.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.133
Really? You're going
to let that slide?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.835
Guy throws
a biscuit at you?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.003
Good evening, all.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.771
Apologies for being so tardy.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.072
Aw, Chris,
you're not tardy.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.641
We tested you twice.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.644
There you guys are.
We were wondering about you.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.512
Brian and I have been
having a blast.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.114
First we went
to a symphony.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.849
Then we saw a small
independent play

13:37.851 --> 13:39.684
with real smoking in it.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.252
And then we hit
the Quahog Book Festival

13:41.254 --> 13:42.921
and went to a Q and A

13:42.923 --> 13:45.256
to ask questions that
weren't really questions.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.293
Wow, look at my sophisticated
young man.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.862
You're certainly taking
to Brian's example.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.697
If anything,
he's teaching me.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.699
I mean, not really,
but you-you know.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.167
Aw, see, I knew Brian

13:56.169 --> 13:57.969
could put Chris on
the path to success.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.370
Hey, Chris,
let's celebrate.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.206
There's a new baby
panda at the zoo.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.541
How about you and me
go chuck tater tots at it?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.542
Chuck them at Lois.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.710
She'll just sit there
and take it.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.045
(chuckling):
Oh, Dad.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.680
That would've been fine
for the old me,

14:08.682 --> 14:10.715
but Brian and I
have to be going.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.384
Oh. Okay.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.853
Yeah, we're off to see
an old movie

14:14.855 --> 14:17.388
on temporary screen
in a muddy, freezing park.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.890
That sounds awful.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.225
(chuckling):
It is awful.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.393
But at least parking
will be impossible.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.796
Bye!

14:24.798 --> 14:29.701
Geez, I... feel like
I just... lost my son.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.736
Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack

14:31.738 --> 14:33.805
and it stings
when I don't wipe right.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.473
This has been
a bad dinner.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.582
There you two are.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.650
Sit down and join us.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.818
I can't stay, Mom.

14:46.820 --> 14:47.986
Brian's showing me

14:47.988 --> 14:49.554
all of his favorite
stuff to do.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.222
Getting spooked when
the furnace goes on?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.424
We're participating
in an autism walk.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.226
Looks like you're
doing it right now.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.995
And we may be gone a while,

14:56.997 --> 14:58.763
'cause after that we're going
down to the Civic Center.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.332
Michael Ian Black is cocking
his eyebrows for four hours.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.235
Ha! He says the things
we don't care to say.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.670
Bye!

15:07.407 --> 15:10.208
Man, I'm sick of how much time
Chris is spending with Brian.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.843
Probably smooching
pickles,

15:11.845 --> 15:13.244
'cause they're a couple
of pickle smoochers.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.846
It's like he ain't
even my son no more,

15:14.848 --> 15:16.681
doing all that
fancy-pants stuff.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.449
Oh, Peter,
I know you miss him,

15:18.451 --> 15:20.251
but this is what
you wanted, isn't it?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.787
Well, yeah, but I didn't
realize bettering himself

15:22.789 --> 15:24.622
meant blowing off
his old man.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.291
You know what?
The hell with this.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.626
I want my son back.
Peter, relax.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.295
Chris is just going
through a phase.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.130
He'll grow out of it.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.934
Just like you grew out of your
"Walk Like An Egyptian" phase.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.303
Paul was a good man.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.271
A good friend.

15:40.273 --> 15:45.476
I'll... I'll always remember
how supportive he was when...

15:45.478 --> 15:47.478
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.280
I can't-I can't-
I can't do this.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.223
Check it out, Lois--
when Chris notices

15:59.225 --> 16:01.159
that "World's Greatest
Son" mug I made,

16:01.161 --> 16:03.828
he'll be back on board with
his old man in no time.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.630
Hey, Chris,
what's on the mug?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.999
"World's Greatest Sun."

16:08.001 --> 16:10.301
This world only has one sun.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.338
What kind of idiot
made this mug?

16:15.809 --> 16:18.576
♪ When everything's
made to be broken ♪

16:18.578 --> 16:20.011
(crying)

16:20.013 --> 16:25.249
♪ I just want you
to know who I am. ♪

16:25.251 --> 16:27.752

16:27.754 --> 16:30.588
♪ It might seems crazy
what I'm about to say... ♪

16:32.926 --> 16:35.760
I'm very easily
influenced by music.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.598
All right, Chris, now I know
you're all sophisticated now,

16:40.600 --> 16:43.534
but no man can resist
the siren call

16:43.536 --> 16:46.337
of mentally impaired
supermodel Kate Upton.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.872
Mm, sorry, Dad.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.341
I'm more of a Catherine
Keener man now.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.943
But, Chris, you got
to take advantage.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.544
The clock's ticking
on Kate Upton.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.979
She's almost at the end
of her window.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.047
(timer dings)

16:56.049 --> 16:57.615
Yup, we missed it.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.183
Come on, get out of here.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.686
(grunting)

17:07.127 --> 17:08.960
Sorry, Lois, I need the TV.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.528
I gotta win my son back.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.063
What are you
talking about, Peter?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.364
Well, you know how
Brian's got Chris

17:13.366 --> 17:15.533
watching all them fancy
foreign films now?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.235
Well, I figure I can
lure Chris in

17:17.237 --> 17:19.971
with this French movie--
<i>Le Rocqué Trois.</i>

17:19.973 --> 17:24.342
(accordion plays<i> Rocky</i> theme
with French lilt)

17:24.344 --> 17:25.977
ADRIENNE (French accent):
<i>Rocqué!</i>

17:25.979 --> 17:27.178
ROCKY (French accent):
<i>Adrienne!</i>

17:27.180 --> 17:29.080
<i>Rocqué!</i>
<i>Adrienne!</i>

17:29.082 --> 17:31.215
MAN (French accent):
<i>J'pité le fool.</i>

17:31.217 --> 17:33.484
ROCKY:
<i>Oh, Clubbert Lange!</i>

17:33.486 --> 17:35.186
Peter, this
is pointless.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.155
You wanted Chris
to be a better person

17:37.157 --> 17:38.656
with a bright future,

17:38.658 --> 17:41.559
and thanks to Brian,
that's what he has now.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.095
Yeah, but, I don't even
recognize Chris these days.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.097
And I never get
to spend time with him.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.433
It's like Chris
ain't my friend no more.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.942
Thanks for coming to the book
club meeting, everyone.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.511
Well, I gotta say,
I loved this week's book--

18:00.513 --> 18:02.613
Annie Proulx's
<i>The Shipping News.</i>

18:02.615 --> 18:04.215
Yes, yes! Yes.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.451
Very<i> Portnoy's Complaint.</i>

18:06.453 --> 18:09.387
Uh, I don't... What, uh,
what do you mean by that?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.522
Oh, you know, just
with... the-the port,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.191
and the shipping.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.293
And of course,
in<i> Portnoy's Complaint</i>

18:15.295 --> 18:17.462
you've got the guy who's
living near the water...

18:17.464 --> 18:19.430
That doesn't sound right.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.200
...and he hated the noise
from the local port,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.901
so he filed one of
the very first

18:23.903 --> 18:26.771
port noise complaints
in maritime law.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.539
And for those of us who
read the complaints,

18:28.541 --> 18:30.641
trust me, they were
very warranted.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.743
Brian, could I talk
to you over here?

18:32.745 --> 18:34.545
Oh, let's dog-ear this
for a sec.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.813
(chuckles)

18:35.815 --> 18:38.116
This one gets it.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.151
Brian, what the hell
are you talking about?

18:40.153 --> 18:42.153
You clearly haven't read
either of those books.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.655
Whoa, Chris, now you're starting
to sound like Mark Twain,

18:44.657 --> 18:46.657
whose real name
was Samuel Clemens.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.426
Oh, that is so your go-to!

18:48.428 --> 18:50.094
I can't believe you.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.797
I thought you were this
worldly, sophisticated guy,

18:52.799 --> 18:55.900
but you're just a fraud--
like Moses.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.935
And the Lord's Eleventh
Commandment--

18:57.937 --> 19:00.905
"Moses gets to be
first in line at the buffet."

19:00.907 --> 19:02.840
What?!
Oh, seriously?

19:02.842 --> 19:04.675
I know, you guys,
it's so lame,

19:04.677 --> 19:06.677
but that's what it says.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.856
Why are you doing that?

19:18.858 --> 19:21.192
Why are you hucking
tater tots at a baby panda?

19:21.194 --> 19:22.693
'Cause I'm oddly
attracted to him

19:22.695 --> 19:24.095
and it frightens me.

19:24.097 --> 19:26.197
See, this is why
you're so great, Dad.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.466
You don't pretend
to be someone you're not.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.869
You do what you want, and you
don't care what anyone thinks.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.804
Well, I-I care what you think.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.375
Look, Chris, you're my kid,
and I want what's best for you,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.677
but I guess
I just don't want you

19:39.679 --> 19:41.679
to become too good
for your old man.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.813
Don't worry, Dad.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.315
I could never be
too good for you

19:44.317 --> 19:45.783
because you're the best.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.352
And I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.722
Really?
Aw, thanks, Chris.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.057
Tater tot?

19:55.828 --> 19:57.395
It's fun, right?
Yeah!

19:57.397 --> 19:59.964
And the mama panda doesn't
do anything about it,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.900
because she was blinded to make
her more submissive.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.135
Ha-ha! You're right.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.037
You know, Chris,
all this started

20:06.039 --> 20:08.706
'cause I was feeling bad
about being a failure.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.975
But you know what?
I got you for a son.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.711
So maybe I did something right.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.746
I love you, Dad.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.985
Come on, Chris.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.854
Let's go get an $18 Coke at
the terrible zoo restaurant.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.658
Yay! Sticky tables
covered in bees!

20:32.232 --> 20:33.764
Coming up, we'll tell you
where to look

20:33.766 --> 20:36.033
when talking to a coworker
in the bathroom.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.902
The answer
might surprise you.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.037
Well, I think we all
learned something today.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.006
In other news,
TVs still make noise,

20:42.008 --> 20:43.608
even when people
resume their conversations.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.443
Yes, studies have determined...
That's right, Peter.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.845
And it's the most
important lesson.
(Tom continues)

20:47.847 --> 20:49.547
Everyone should be
who they are.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.616
Success is being
true to yourself.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.517
Amen, Mom.
(Tom continues)

20:53.519 --> 20:56.120
But to have the love of your
family, that's true success.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.588
Let's go ahead and
turn off the TV.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.856
TOM:
There we go.
