00:48.516 --> 00:50.215
All right, everyone,

00:50.217 --> 00:51.884
it's time to open up
our bank statements.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.319
Let's gather
'round for prayer.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.555
Hey, God, it's the Griffins.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.323
Again, we're very sorry

00:58.325 --> 00:59.725
we cyber-bullied
that girl to death.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.660
But we still want a snowmobile.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.195
Today, though,
please let there be money

01:03.197 --> 01:04.530
in our bank account.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.131
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.667
Damn it.
It didn't work.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.202
We're still poor.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.871
Peter, every month our savings
get smaller and smaller.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.706
We really gotta
figure out a better way

01:14.708 --> 01:16.175
to budget for this
family's future.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.376
Bitcoin.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.677
What?
I don't know.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.045
This is serious.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.014
We need to think
about our kids' education.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.750
Of course, it's already too late
for Meg to go to college.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.186
And Chris is too dumb
to get in anywhere.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.353
Yay!

01:28.355 --> 01:29.688
No, Chris.
Not yay.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.690
But there's still
time for Stewie.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.859
Let's sit down later
and see if we can figure out

01:33.861 --> 01:35.694
a plan to get our
finances in order.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.062
Eh, don't worry
about it, Lois.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.864
I will always provide
for the family.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.732
Even if I have to
shoot our dinner.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.367
(screaming)

01:42.369 --> 01:44.236
(gunshot)

01:44.238 --> 01:46.538
This will look great
in my study.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.273
I'm a hunter,

01:48.275 --> 01:50.609
but I'm a silly hunter.

01:55.249 --> 01:58.050
(clears throat)

01:58.052 --> 01:59.251

01:59.253 --> 02:00.719
Hey, don't fill up on that.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.121
We got breakfast coming.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.456
Hey, Peter, I think
I figured out one way

02:04.458 --> 02:06.258
we can save money
for Stewie's college.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.961
If we bundle our cable
and Internet together,

02:08.963 --> 02:11.296
we can save
$14 a month.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.732
No! Bundling is
a sign of defeat!

02:13.734 --> 02:15.567
Plus, I figured out
something better.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.803
A metal detector.
What?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.938
Yeah, it combines two of
America's greatest resources:

02:19.940 --> 02:21.240
garbage and luck.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.441
That's stupid,
Peter.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.976
Ah, you're just
saying that

02:23.978 --> 02:25.777
because the battery it uses
causes bladder cancer.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.146
Well, then, I'm off.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.148
I shall be at the beach
looking for valuables

02:29.150 --> 02:31.083
and occasionally using
a doorless bathroom.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.651
Good day, madam.

Man, your mom's
a real groaner.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.929
Do you hear that
in your room?

02:43.931 --> 02:46.665
Hey, Dad,
where are you going?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.834
Well, Meg, now that
I'm a metal detector guy,

02:48.836 --> 02:51.436
I gotta start eating breakfast
at on-the-sand cafés,

02:51.438 --> 02:53.005
where I will
judge tourists

02:53.007 --> 02:55.107
as my skin browns
and hardens.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.842
Stop throwing your kid's diapers

02:56.844 --> 02:59.378
in the trash
with all the soda cans!

03:02.983 --> 03:05.551
Hey, Lois, check out what
I found with my metal detector.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.488
Are those... are
those Purple Hearts?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.356
Yeah, some idiot buried,
like, a hundred of 'em

03:11.358 --> 03:13.025
in this big lawn
under these bone cages.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.526
Peter!

03:14.528 --> 03:17.162
I think you desecrated
a military graveyard!

03:17.164 --> 03:18.830
Hey, guys, like four jeeps

03:18.832 --> 03:20.365
just drove up
onto our front yard.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.867
They must be here
for the medals!

03:21.869 --> 03:23.835
Maybe. Or it could be
because of my

03:23.837 --> 03:26.238
"I'm Gonna Barf
on the White House" blog.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.376
(metal detector beeping)

03:31.378 --> 03:32.711
(beeping increases)

03:32.713 --> 03:35.547
Ah, sweet!

03:35.549 --> 03:37.382
Huh.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.451
Wonder what happens if I turn it
on and point 'em at each other.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.356
Oh, my God!

03:44.358 --> 03:46.992
Did you also call
into a talk show

03:46.994 --> 03:49.695
without turning down
your radio first?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.697
(beeping)

03:51.699 --> 03:52.731
(beeping increases)

03:52.733 --> 03:54.566
Jackpot.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.168
Wow, an iPad!

03:56.170 --> 03:57.402
This thing finds
everything!

03:57.404 --> 03:59.404
(beeps)
Engagement ring!

03:59.406 --> 04:01.240
(beeps)
Family locket!

04:01.242 --> 04:03.242
(beeps)
Sunglasses that are an upgrade

04:03.244 --> 04:05.577
over my current pair!
MAN:
There he is!

04:05.579 --> 04:08.413
There's the guy who's been
stealing everyone's stuff!

04:08.415 --> 04:11.016
Don't yell at me,
I'm very sunburned!

04:11.018 --> 04:14.453
(clattering)
Go, crappy car, go!

04:17.591 --> 04:20.892
Peter, did you rob
a bunch of people

04:20.894 --> 04:22.594
on the beach
with your metal detector?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.229
Well, that's only
half the story.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.265
I also hooted at a lady
who was breastfeeding.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.700
I want you to get rid
of that metal detector.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.435
All you're doing is
getting into trouble

04:30.437 --> 04:32.437
and digging up junk
when we really need

04:32.439 --> 04:34.106
to be saving
for Stewie's college.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.774
Tomorrow we are
going to the mall

04:35.776 --> 04:37.609
and returning that
thing to the store.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.278
(sighs)
Okay, fine.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.747
But you should know, the day
I bought this metal detector

04:41.749 --> 04:44.116
was the happiest
day of my life.

04:44.118 --> 04:47.119
Well, obviously,
the second happiest.

Panda Express

05:31.498 --> 05:33.632
while squeezin' our purchases
between our knees

05:33.634 --> 05:35.000

might grab 'em.

God, the mall sucks,
doesn't it, kids?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.970

I'd shop online.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.505
Oh, hey, Bonnie.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.940
What are you guys
doing here?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.275
Oh, hey, Lois.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.277
We saw an ad
looking for a toddler

05:45.279 --> 05:47.012
to appear in a peanut
butter commercial

05:47.014 --> 05:49.348
and we thought
we'd bring Susie.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.017
Joe, are you wearing
a corsage?
Yeah.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.119
You can get a really good deal
on them after prom season.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.320
They're for girls, Joe.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.855
Hey, Peter,

05:56.857 --> 05:59.825
why don't you let me do me,
and you do you, okay?

05:59.827 --> 06:01.526
Peanut butter commercial, huh?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.195
Hey, Bri, maybe
you should audition.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.364
You know, because of that
one time you got in the trash

06:05.366 --> 06:07.366
and ate a whole jar of
recalled peanut butter?

06:07.368 --> 06:09.034
It wasn't peanut butter.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.836
It was that pre-mixed peanut
butter and jelly thing.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.371
Oh, Mom bought that?

06:12.373 --> 06:15.040
That's what the scab kid
at school always has!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.842
That was really great, Jake.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.043
Really, really great.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.811
Your face is upside-down,

06:19.813 --> 06:22.013
so we're not gonna pick you,
but thanks for coming.

more of a

06:34.995 --> 06:37.562
Bob, look over there!

06:37.564 --> 06:39.965
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num-num!

06:41.402 --> 06:42.701
Whose kid is that?

06:42.703 --> 06:44.536
Oh, that's our son, Stewie.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.004
He's adorable!

06:46.006 --> 06:47.906
And exactly what
we're looking for!

06:47.908 --> 06:51.676

is the new peanut butter kid!

06:51.678 --> 06:53.678

06:53.680 --> 06:55.247
That's so cool!

06:55.249 --> 06:57.349
Hey, what's Dad doing
over there with Chris?

06:57.351 --> 07:00.252
Oh, he's telling him that he's
no longer his favorite son.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.287
(no audio)

07:03.590 --> 07:05.257
No!

07:05.259 --> 07:08.093
(sobbing):
No, Daddy!

07:08.095 --> 07:11.430
Daddy!

07:11.432 --> 07:13.398
Daddy...

07:13.400 --> 07:15.467
(grunting)

07:20.407 --> 07:22.407
I didn't even tell him.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.309
He just does not
like to be touched.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.918
Thanks for coming
to the viewing party

07:32.920 --> 07:35.053
for Stewie's commercial,
everybody.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.923
We're sorry that it's airing
during<i> 2 Broke Girls,</i>

07:37.925 --> 07:39.791
but we have no
control over that.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.893
Thanks for coming to
my big night, Brian.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.796
I see you got all dressed up
in your exposed wiener.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.965
Quiet, everybody!
Here it comes!

07:48.969 --> 07:51.002

07:51.939 --> 07:53.472
There's my family!

07:53.474 --> 07:55.574
H-Hey, wait,
where's the baby?

07:55.576 --> 07:58.109
Well, he likes
his hero dad,

07:58.111 --> 08:00.645
but he loves
Scooter's Peanut Butter.

08:00.647 --> 08:04.282

08:11.291 --> 08:13.592

who did a baby thing.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.160
Let's all calm down
a little.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.496
Wow, I can't believe
Stewie's a commercial star.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.431

09:01.708 --> 09:04.142
Apparently, he gets paid
every time it airs.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.710
This is great.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.046
We can put it right into
Stewie's college fund.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.015
Yeah, yeah,
but, you know,

09:10.017 --> 09:11.883
maybe we should keep
a little bit out to celebrate.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.685
I mean, I ain't
done nothin' fancy

09:13.687 --> 09:15.687
since I bought
those rich guy socks.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.355
Ah, there.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.559
I'm ready to get caught
cheating with my secretary.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.128
♪ ♪

09:25.832 --> 09:27.399
Welcome, folks.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.401
Would you like flat
or sparkling water to start?

09:29.403 --> 09:30.702
Garden hose
will be fine.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.038
We prefer it to be hot
and then metal-y.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.506
Actually, Peter,

09:34.508 --> 09:36.408
let's go for the
sparkling water.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.909
I mean, we are
celebrating

09:37.911 --> 09:40.579
our little commercial
star and his big payday.

Oh, I don't care
about that, ma'am.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.516
You know, this is
a nice dinner and all,

09:44.518 --> 09:46.351
but I thought you guys
were going to save

09:46.353 --> 09:48.353
this commercial money
for Stewie's college fund.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.522
We are saving it, Brian.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.257
This is just
a little celebration.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.392
The rest of it is going
right in the bank.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.927
Yeah, and besides,
it's been a while

09:55.929 --> 09:57.862
since we ate at a place
where if you ask for ketchup,

09:57.864 --> 09:59.097
they look at you
like you're dirt.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.765
You know, Stewie
actually got a call

10:00.767 --> 10:02.233
for another
commercial tomorrow.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.935
Who knows?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.104
This could be the beginning
of a nice career for him.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.606
You sure about this, Lois?

10:07.608 --> 10:09.441
I mean... I mean,
the world of child acting

10:09.443 --> 10:11.376
can be a pretty bad
environment for a kid.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.378
Maybe we should just
let Stewie's childhood

10:13.380 --> 10:14.779
be about being a child.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.781
Wasn't your kid an actor,
you jagoff?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.550
Didn't your father
hate your guts and die?

10:18.552 --> 10:19.784
Whoa!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.286
Bring a gun to a knife fight.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.721
Look, I-I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.255
All I'm saying is,

10:24.257 --> 10:26.124
just try to keep Stewie's
best interests in mind.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.559
Relax, Brian.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.060
Stewie's fine.
I mean, look at him.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.129
He's happier than
a sunny-side-up egg.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.131

to start the day.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.967

10:41.642 --> 10:43.475
Help, he's only
gonna eat the toast

10:43.477 --> 10:45.543
and put a cigarette out on me.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.416
Okay, Stewie, you booked
the last commercial

10:51.418 --> 10:54.252
without even trying, so this
one should be a piece of cake.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.454
(low chatter)

10:56.456 --> 10:59.824
Oh, I guess there are other
people auditioning, too.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.294
Oh, is your child up for the
cough syrup commercial, too?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.296
You'd have no way
of knowing this,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.298
but the moms tend
to dress up.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
Oh, thank you.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.136
And you'd have
no way of knowing

11:11.138 --> 11:12.971
that my son is the
Scooter's Peanut Butter Kid.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.973
(chuckles):
That's cute.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.343
My son had a gun waved in
his face in a<i> Dexter</i> episode.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.812
Are you guys talking
about your kids?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.581
My daughter is the
American Apparel slut baby.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.486
My son got crapped on

11:28.488 --> 11:31.489
God, everyone here
is so talented.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.858
Hi, everybody, we're
a little crunched for time,

11:33.860 --> 11:35.694
so we're gonna have
to audition people

11:35.696 --> 11:37.028
right here in the hallway.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.496
You, do something
exceptional.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.432
Uh, okay.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.837

11:45.839 --> 11:47.672

Oh, my grundle.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.041
It's bruised.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.509
It's bruised bad.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.344
Oh, okay, I'm out, I'm out.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.713
Tappin' out.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.182
Well, that was
a disaster.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.184
It was humiliating
is what it was.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.552
That woman just smiled

12:00.554 --> 12:02.554
when Stewie banged
his balls on the floor.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.556
A damn disaster.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.729
They were amazing.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.197
One of them was texting

12:12.199 --> 12:14.032

from<i> Modern Family.</i>

12:14.034 --> 12:15.567
I want to text with that kid.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.402
Holy Christmas, there were
a lot of hot moms

12:17.404 --> 12:19.070
in yoga pants in there, though.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.906
Dear me, they're really
disappointed in me, Rupert.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.742
I haven't seen
the fat man this upset

12:23.744 --> 12:25.677
since he went
to the 9/11 museum.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.679
Lois made us do this,

12:27.681 --> 12:30.749
but I wanted to go to the
Central Park merry-go-round.

do you get pleasure out of

15:19.352 --> 15:20.718
Oh, we got a new one.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.553
Stewie booked that
orange juice commercial,

15:22.555 --> 15:24.923
so we thought we'd make a few
upgrades around the house.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.926
Yeah, I even bought an awesome

16:09.970 --> 16:11.636

can spend the money you earned

16:19.412 --> 16:20.812
on crap they
don't even need?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.247
Uh, I'm not supposed
to use my voice

16:23.249 --> 16:25.083

stuff, Brian.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.918

are you in?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.541
He did porn.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.376
Boner from<i> Growing Pains?</i> Dead.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.378
Screech from
<i>Saved by the Bell?</i> Porn.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.813
Corey Haim? Dead.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.149
Dana Plato? Porn, then dead.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.884
Oh, no, this is horrible.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.353
You see, Stewie, there are
tons of actors like this.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.355
They all started out
just like you,

17:37.357 --> 17:38.723
but eventually
they were destroyed

17:38.725 --> 17:40.558
by their parents'
greed, drugs

17:40.560 --> 17:42.026
or perverted
Hollywood directors.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.394
Oh, like Bryan Singer.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.230
Exactly. The point is
it's a dark path.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.699
My God, I had no idea
it could be so bad.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.535
Brian, I don't want
to act anymore.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.538
Good. Now we just got to make
Peter and Lois understand.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.540
Yes, well, if they want
to make me into a monster

17:55.542 --> 17:58.376
like those people, we'll
give 'em a monster.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.578
Like when Godzilla
attacked Haiti.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.246
(flames crackling)

18:02.248 --> 18:04.715
(roars)

18:04.717 --> 18:06.784
Oh, my God.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.430
Peter, did you
get my text?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.866
No, hold on.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.868
No, I don't know
what he's doing here.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.270
Okay, Stewie, when Barbara
hands you that orange juice,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.106
you're gonna drink it
and smile.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.541
And really show us that
energy from your audition.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.543
H-Hold on a second,
he's got a smudge on his face.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.078
Let me just take care
of that for you guys.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.446
Here, drink this.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.914
I threw a little Molly
in there, too,

18:36.916 --> 18:38.349
so we'll go out
clubbing afterwards.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.422
Hey, you want this?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.790
Sure, I'll
drink anything.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.458
All right, action!

18:47.460 --> 18:50.795
As a mom, I want my kids
to start their day right.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.897
And there's no better way
than with a glass

18:52.899 --> 18:55.299
of fresh-squeezed
Sunnydale Orange Juice.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.734
Isn't that right,
sweetie?

18:56.736 --> 18:58.569
Shut your hole, bitch!

18:58.571 --> 19:00.571
I'll tell you what I want
fresh-squeezed-- these.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.973
(shrieks)

19:01.975 --> 19:03.274
What the hell's
he doing?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.809
He's blowing this.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.279
Oh, here's what I think
of this orange juice.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.282
(grunting)

19:11.284 --> 19:14.285
I-I can't... I can't go right
now with everybody watching.

19:14.287 --> 19:17.989
But-but I presume you understand
the disrespect I intended.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.991
Oh, my God, he's
having a meltdown.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.425
You don't suppose this
has anything to do

19:21.427 --> 19:23.427
with the sleep deprivation
and narcotics?

19:23.429 --> 19:26.264
Oh, Peter, what have
we been thinking?

19:26.266 --> 19:29.267
It's us-- we're the ones
who turned him into this.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.569
Get this kid out of here!
He's fired.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.971
Well done.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.339
Not a bad performance.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.807
Thank you, Brian, I...

19:36.809 --> 19:37.808
Uh, there's the poop.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.809
Right now.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.178
Oh, Stewie.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.180
Mommy and Daddy are so sorry.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.016
I-I guess we just got
too caught up in your success

19:45.018 --> 19:47.018
and forgot that you're
just a baby.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.486
You were
right, Brian.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.855
I guess we pushed Stewie
a little too hard.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.857
Well, the good news is
that now he can go back

19:52.859 --> 19:54.859
to being a regular kid.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.861
♪ ♪

19:56.863 --> 19:58.863
Why are you winking at
our baby, you creep?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.698
God, that's weird.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.600
I don't want to ever
see that happen again.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.640
Well, we went a little crazy
there, didn't we, Peter?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.042
But I'm glad we have

20:11.044 --> 20:13.844
our normal, very average,
non-famous baby back.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.680
You know, I was once
a very famous baby.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.315
Were you, Peter?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.517
No, but you see how easy
it is for me to lie to you?

20:19.519 --> 20:21.219
I do it every day.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.654
Anyway, looks like everything
worked out for the best.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.656
You know, Brian, that acting
stuff was a bit much for me,

20:25.658 --> 20:28.226
but I did quite enjoy
the dancing and the cocaine.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.061
Yeah?
Yep.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.896
So you're just gonna be a
dancer and a drug addict?

20:31.898 --> 20:34.365
For a while. I might
crash when I'm 18,

20:34.367 --> 20:36.734
but then I'll just turn
to the Lord and working out.

20:36.736 --> 20:41.339
I'll-I'll just be a 180-degree
different type of insufferable.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.341
I used to need drugs
to feel powerful,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.743
but now my power comes
from my core strength.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.578
And let's look at that
word, "strength."

20:47.580 --> 20:49.580
The "S" stands
for sacrifice.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.382
No gain without
sacrifice.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.051
The "T," of course, stands for
the sufferings of the cross.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.853
The "R"...
You want some cocaine?

20:55.855 --> 20:58.422
Oh, my God, please, yes!
That's all I want all the time!
