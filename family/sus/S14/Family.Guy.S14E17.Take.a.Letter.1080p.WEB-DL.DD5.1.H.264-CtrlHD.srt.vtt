Peter, we got to talk.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.927
Ugh.

00:36.929 --> 00:38.996
I'm concerned about
Stewie's preschool.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.164
Look what they're serving
at snack time.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.466
Is-is that...?

00:42.468 --> 00:43.934
It's dog milk.

00:43.936 --> 00:45.936
They're serving dog milk
to our children.

00:45.938 --> 00:47.838
Aw, sweet, dilk.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.973
I don't want Stewie
in that school anymore.

00:49.975 --> 00:51.975
It seems like
it's really gone downhill.

00:51.977 --> 00:53.543
She's not wrong to worry.

00:53.545 --> 00:55.112
There's a sign
in the bathroom that says,

00:55.114 --> 00:57.147
"If it's brown, let it mellow."

00:57.149 --> 00:59.116
Sometimes it crests
the toilet lid.

00:59.118 --> 01:01.351
Peter, I think we should
send Stewie to Corridors.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.819
I know it's
a little pricey,

01:02.821 --> 01:04.454
but it's the best
preschool in the area.

01:04.456 --> 01:06.623
Really? Is that the one
where they make 'em dress

01:06.625 --> 01:09.159
in the little shorts and hats
like the guy in AC/DC?

01:09.161 --> 01:10.660
Yeah, why does he
wear that outfit?

01:10.662 --> 01:12.162
'Cause he rocks.

01:12.164 --> 01:14.231
♪ ♪

01:14.233 --> 01:15.732
When I picked this,

01:15.734 --> 01:19.336
I didn't know I'd have
to wear it when I'm 60!

01:19.338 --> 01:21.571
I'm very cold!

01:26.211 --> 01:28.412
You know what seems
like a lie to me?

01:28.414 --> 01:31.014
A Forever stamp that says
"Love" on it.

01:31.016 --> 01:32.983
Oh, you want to
go ahead of me?

01:32.985 --> 01:34.384
Hey, how are you?

01:34.386 --> 01:36.720
You know what seems
like a lie to me?

01:36.722 --> 01:39.156
I can help the fourth
person in line.

01:39.158 --> 01:41.525
One, two, three... yes!

01:41.527 --> 01:43.860
Cleveland,
you work here?

01:43.862 --> 01:46.196
Yup, finally landed
myself a job.

01:46.198 --> 01:48.832
Hey, what can
Brown do for you?

01:48.834 --> 01:49.866
(laughs)

01:49.868 --> 01:51.201
That's our competitor,
though.

01:51.203 --> 01:52.702
I'm not supposed
to say that.

01:52.704 --> 01:55.539
It's grounds for dismissal
if anyone ever got fired here,

01:55.541 --> 01:56.540
but they don't.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.041
Well, good for you.

01:58.043 --> 01:59.776
Oh, could I get a
return receipt for this?

01:59.778 --> 02:02.612
It's Stewie's registration
form for his new school.

02:02.614 --> 02:04.414
Lil' Papa Stew-Stew's
off to college?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.715
No, just preschool.

02:05.717 --> 02:06.850
He's very young.

02:06.852 --> 02:09.219
Can you just charge me
my weirdly uneven price

02:09.221 --> 02:10.454
so I can be done?

02:10.456 --> 02:13.023
All right, that's $2.16.

02:13.025 --> 02:16.726
$4.37 if you want to
send it the priority.

02:16.728 --> 02:18.895
Oh, no, we got to start
saving our pennies

02:18.897 --> 02:21.031
now that we're sending
Stewie to a new school.

02:21.033 --> 02:22.899
I'm actually doing some
job hunting after this.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.401
SEAMUS:
Let's go up there!

02:24.403 --> 02:26.536
You know, Lois,
the post office is hiring.

02:26.538 --> 02:27.537
Really?

02:27.539 --> 02:29.239
Oh, wow, that'd be great.

02:29.241 --> 02:31.475
Yeah, I'd be happy to
get you an interview,

02:31.477 --> 02:33.977
and as a white woman,
you'd be a minority here,

02:33.979 --> 02:36.279
unless you're an alcoholic.

02:46.758 --> 02:49.292
Wow, this place
is really fancy.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.661
Their Flat Stanley is
actually award-winning actor

02:51.663 --> 02:53.230
Stanley Tucci.

02:53.232 --> 02:57.067
Sometimes I wear glasses
and sometimes I don't.

02:57.069 --> 02:58.635
Hi, I'm Chadley.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.970
I've been kidnapped
three times

02:59.972 --> 03:01.271
because I come
from money.

03:01.273 --> 03:03.073
Oh, yes, I've heard
about your family.

03:03.075 --> 03:05.175
You've had two older
brothers die of drugs?

03:05.177 --> 03:06.176
That's right.

03:06.178 --> 03:07.410
Stewie, what would you say

03:07.412 --> 03:09.112
to a playdate at
my house tomorrow?

03:09.114 --> 03:11.248
That sounds delightful.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.451
My word, it feels so good
to finally be where I belong.

03:14.453 --> 03:17.587
Like Judd Hirsch at
the gigantic sweater store.

03:17.589 --> 03:20.423
Hi, uh, all five of us
are Judd Hirsch.

03:20.425 --> 03:22.826
Do you have a sweater big
enough to fit all of us?

03:24.196 --> 03:26.163
Okay, everybody climb in.

03:27.266 --> 03:30.367
Ah, I can't wait
to spill soup on this.

03:30.369 --> 03:33.270
Okay, Judds, shamble away.

03:38.143 --> 03:39.709
Good having
you aboard, Lois.

03:39.711 --> 03:41.478
Let me show you around.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.646
That guy right there?

03:42.648 --> 03:43.647
Larry.

03:43.649 --> 03:44.648
Okay, got it.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.183
A-And what's this giant,

03:46.185 --> 03:48.685
(echoing): empty,
football-stadium-sized room?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.654
Oh, the post office
anticipates

03:50.656 --> 03:52.322
that within the
next five years

03:52.324 --> 03:55.158
at least 200 million men
in this country will be

03:55.160 --> 03:57.494
ordering and
receiving RealDolls.

03:57.496 --> 04:00.330
Every man will have seven
to nine RealDolls.

04:00.332 --> 04:02.465
Asians, blonde
Southern girls,

04:02.467 --> 04:04.634
blonde Asians
capable of performing

04:04.636 --> 04:06.570
every possible sexual act,

04:06.572 --> 04:08.672
or at least incapable
of refusing.

04:08.674 --> 04:10.073
You can put one
in your car

04:10.075 --> 04:12.576
and drive in the car pool
lane with it and then

04:12.578 --> 04:15.312
maybe you push her head down,
thus defeating the purpose

04:15.314 --> 04:17.681
of the car pool lane
while fulfilling the purpose

04:17.683 --> 04:18.915
of the RealDoll.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.350
Maybe a trucker goes by.

04:20.352 --> 04:23.019
You say, "Hey, Janine,
give him a show."

04:23.021 --> 04:25.755
Maybe later you ask yourself
some tough questions, like,

04:25.757 --> 04:27.490
"Why is it so
important to you

04:27.492 --> 04:29.226
to impress and
excite truckers?"

04:29.228 --> 04:31.027
Anyhoo, grab that
letter opener.

04:31.029 --> 04:33.997
I'm gonna show you why you
should never mail cash.

04:37.502 --> 04:39.369
Another good postal tip is,

04:39.371 --> 04:41.338
if you wait to deliver
your mail at night,

04:41.340 --> 04:44.040
you can smell a lot
of really nice dinners.

04:44.042 --> 04:46.776
Oh, no, it's that
Amazon drone.

04:46.778 --> 04:48.044
Try to ignore it.

04:48.046 --> 04:49.679
Hey, Cleveland,
what are you doing?

04:49.681 --> 04:50.714
Taking a walk?

04:50.716 --> 04:52.382
No, I'm delivering mail.

04:52.384 --> 04:53.383
By foot?

04:53.385 --> 04:55.051
Yeah, that won't take too long.

04:55.053 --> 04:56.186
Well, got to go.

04:56.188 --> 05:00.056
Got to deliver these fat pants
to your fat son.

05:00.058 --> 05:02.292
He was harsh but
not untruthful.

05:02.294 --> 05:04.394
We got to special-order
Cleveland Jr.'s pants

05:04.396 --> 05:07.764
from a company that
manufactures grill covers.

05:12.738 --> 05:14.137
Thanks for coming
over, Stewie.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.305
Oh, thanks
for having me.

05:15.307 --> 05:16.740
Quite a place
you've got here.

05:16.742 --> 05:18.074
Your mother seemed nice.

05:18.076 --> 05:20.910
Yeah, I've only met her
a couple of times, but yeah.

05:20.912 --> 05:22.145
This is my bedroom.

05:26.418 --> 05:28.985
Is that car bed
a Bentley?

05:28.987 --> 05:30.420
And is that guy
the driver?

05:30.422 --> 05:33.256
Ready for this evening's
trip to Snoozetown, sir?

05:33.258 --> 05:34.257
Not yet.

05:34.259 --> 05:35.258
Sad story.

05:35.260 --> 05:36.660
He used to drive the bed

05:36.662 --> 05:37.994
for Michael
Jackson's monkey.

05:37.996 --> 05:40.096
CHAUFFEUR:
I've seen some
terrible things.

05:40.098 --> 05:41.598
This is extraordinary.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.966
Oh, it's fine,
I suppose,

05:42.968 --> 05:44.267
but you probably have

05:44.269 --> 05:46.002
even nicer things
at your mansion.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.671
I'd love to come
see it sometime.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.939
Oh, um, y-yes,
yes, my mansion.

05:49.941 --> 05:52.108
Y-Yes, you-you should
come see my mansion,

05:52.110 --> 05:53.276
b-by all means.

05:53.278 --> 05:54.511
I mean, not-not
right this minute.

05:54.513 --> 05:56.846
I-I have the U.S.
men's wrestling team there--

05:56.848 --> 05:57.981
I'm gonna kill a wrestler--

05:57.983 --> 05:59.249
but then after that,
you should.

05:59.251 --> 06:00.583
I can't wait.

06:00.585 --> 06:02.619
Come on, let's go see if
the maid brought her son,

06:02.621 --> 06:05.288
so we can push him and
he can't do anything.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.824
God, I like it here,
but what am I doing?

06:07.826 --> 06:09.326
I don't have a fancy house.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.095
I'm living a lie, like FDR.

06:12.097 --> 06:16.833
And so I say to you, America,
we are going to win this war,

06:16.835 --> 06:18.868
we're going to end
this depression,

06:18.870 --> 06:22.305
and there's no reason
to suspect that I cannot walk.

06:22.307 --> 06:24.307
God bless America!

06:24.309 --> 06:28.311
("Hail to the Chief" plays)

06:28.313 --> 06:29.346
And cut.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.380
The newsreel's over.

06:30.382 --> 06:32.182
Thank you, Mr. President.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.683
You're welcome, gentlemen.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.253
Now, if you'd kindly kick me
into the closet with the mops.

06:40.659 --> 06:43.193
Ah, must be a Yale man.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.561
Shut up.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.200
Hello, loyal mailwoman.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.968
This is a letter
to Hollywood,

06:51.970 --> 06:54.804
saying, "Keep it up!
Movies are great!"

06:55.807 --> 06:57.807
Cleveland, what should
I do with this?

06:57.809 --> 06:59.743
I-It just says
"Hollywood, U.S.A.,"

06:59.745 --> 07:01.144
and this isn't a stamp,

07:01.146 --> 07:02.812
it's the little
sticker from an apple.

07:02.814 --> 07:04.481
Oh, I can't never
get those off.

07:04.483 --> 07:05.515
I just eat them.

07:05.517 --> 07:07.150
Anyway, just put
it in here.

07:07.152 --> 07:08.184
But what's that?

07:08.186 --> 07:09.519
It's the dead letter bin.

07:09.521 --> 07:12.322
It's all the stale mail
what never got delivered

07:12.324 --> 07:15.525
for one reason or the other:
incomplete addresses,

07:15.527 --> 07:18.661
house at the top of a hill,
anyone who uses one of those

07:18.663 --> 07:20.864
French sevens with
a slash in it.

07:20.866 --> 07:22.198
Well, this is horrible.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.533
I'm going to organize these.

07:23.535 --> 07:25.034
There might be some
we could resend.

07:25.036 --> 07:26.770
That's above
and beyond, Lois.

07:26.772 --> 07:29.005
You know, you do
the uniform proud,

07:29.007 --> 07:30.407
like I like to think I--

07:30.409 --> 07:32.709
oh, chili dog got me.

07:32.711 --> 07:33.710
Look at all these.

07:33.712 --> 07:34.778
This is a mess.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.380
Here's two that
are stuck together.

07:37.382 --> 07:38.782
What the hell?

07:38.784 --> 07:40.016
This is from Peter.

07:43.221 --> 07:45.588
Who the hell is Gretchen Mercer?

07:45.590 --> 07:49.092
And this is postmarked
a week before our wedding!

07:54.065 --> 07:56.733
Aw, there was a time
when the president

07:56.735 --> 08:00.103
of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas
Fan Club got a lot of mail.

08:08.046 --> 08:09.779
I don't know
what to do, Bonnie.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.281
Why would Peter
write a letter

08:11.283 --> 08:13.917
to another woman
just before our wedding?

08:13.919 --> 08:15.752
Why don't you just
open it and read it?

08:15.754 --> 08:16.786
What?!

08:16.788 --> 08:18.154
Th-That's a
federal offense.

08:18.156 --> 08:19.489
I can't do that.

08:19.491 --> 08:21.257
Don't you realize,
as a postal employee,

08:21.259 --> 08:24.060
I'm 6,004th in line
for the presidency?

08:24.062 --> 08:25.895
Well, then why don't you
just deliver the letter

08:25.897 --> 08:28.798
and see for yourself
who this Gretchen Mercer is?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.767
Bonnie,
that's a great idea.

08:30.769 --> 08:32.769
Although it could be
a little awkward.

08:32.771 --> 08:35.104
You could always just
ask Peter about it.

08:35.106 --> 08:37.273
No, he won't talk
about anything serious

08:37.275 --> 08:38.775
unless there's
a crackling fire

08:38.777 --> 08:41.778
to punctuate uncomfortable
family revelations.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.247
(fire crackling)

08:44.249 --> 08:45.849
I didn't fall
off the roof.

08:45.851 --> 08:47.417
I jumped.

08:47.419 --> 08:48.852
(fire crackling)

08:48.854 --> 08:50.620
I never found
you attractive,

08:50.622 --> 08:52.956
and what's more,
I never respected you.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.457
(fire crackling)

08:54.459 --> 08:56.459
I know about Maurice.

08:56.461 --> 08:58.962
(fire crackling)

08:58.964 --> 09:01.364
Which Maurice?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.203
Oh, Brian,
I need your help!

09:07.205 --> 09:09.038
Chadley wants to
have a playdate,

09:09.040 --> 09:10.139
here at my house!

09:10.141 --> 09:11.875
Well, that's great.
No, it's not!

09:11.877 --> 09:13.309
I can't let him
see this dump.

09:13.311 --> 09:16.212
Come on, Stewie, Chadley should
like you for who are.

09:16.214 --> 09:17.814
Besides, this place
isn't so bad.

09:17.816 --> 09:21.017
Brian, Chadley's parents
each have their own bathroom.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.620
I've seen the fat man
pee through Lois' legs

09:23.622 --> 09:25.154
while she's sitting
on the toilet.

09:25.156 --> 09:27.290
What I've got to do
is find a spectacular house

09:27.292 --> 09:29.792
that I can pretend is mine
to impress Chadley.

09:29.794 --> 09:31.561
Oh, why don't you just
use Babs and Carter's?

09:31.563 --> 09:32.729
I can't, they're having

09:32.731 --> 09:34.831
an<i> Eyes Wide Shut</i>
party all weekend.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.333
I can't find my wiener
with this mask.

09:37.335 --> 09:38.334
All right, time-out.

09:38.336 --> 09:39.802
Let's-let's all just find

09:39.804 --> 09:42.238
our wieners and then
put the masks back on.

09:47.512 --> 09:50.647
Okay, 940,
this is the house.

09:50.649 --> 09:52.749
(doorbell rings)

09:52.751 --> 09:54.884
Hi, are you
Gretchen Mercer?

09:54.886 --> 09:56.319
Yes, may I help you?

09:56.321 --> 10:00.990
Oh, yeah, we found an old
letter addressed to you.

10:00.992 --> 10:02.525
Peter Griffin?

10:02.527 --> 10:04.694
Wow, this is from
an old boyfriend.

10:04.696 --> 10:05.762
What?

10:05.764 --> 10:07.063
(laughs nervously)

10:07.065 --> 10:09.098
Wow, well, um,
here-here's the nutty thing:

10:09.100 --> 10:10.333
believe it or not,

10:10.335 --> 10:13.202
I'm actually married
to Peter Griffin right now.

10:13.204 --> 10:15.738
Huh, that is quite
a coincidence.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.907
I wonder why he
was writing me.

10:19.878 --> 10:21.210
I see you move
your finger along

10:21.212 --> 10:22.211
as you read.

10:22.213 --> 10:23.880
That's what
little kids do.

10:23.882 --> 10:25.081
Oh, it was nothing.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.250
He was just writing
to say that he was excited

10:27.252 --> 10:29.519
about getting married
and that he finally had enough

10:29.521 --> 10:32.555
Camel Cash to get a leather
jacket and a pool floatie.

10:32.557 --> 10:34.357
Huh, well,
thank you, Gretchen.

10:34.359 --> 10:35.792
I am very relieved.

10:35.794 --> 10:37.093
I was thinking the worst.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.394
Oh, I understand,

10:38.396 --> 10:40.563
but you have nothing
to worry about.

10:40.565 --> 10:41.564
You're right.

10:41.566 --> 10:43.700
I guess jealousy's
my weak spot.

10:43.702 --> 10:45.201
(chuckling):
Everyone has one.

10:45.203 --> 10:46.603
Even Achilles.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.205
So, you can only be injured
on your Achilles' tendon?

10:49.207 --> 10:50.239
That's right.

10:50.241 --> 10:51.808
My mother dipped me
into the River Styx

10:51.810 --> 10:53.309
and she held me by my heel,

10:53.311 --> 10:55.378
so that's the only part
that can be injured.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.779
How about you, Testiclies?

10:56.781 --> 10:59.582
It's the same--
it's-it's-it's similar.

10:59.584 --> 11:03.653
(piano music playing)

11:07.425 --> 11:09.425
So, what do you think
of the house, Brian?

11:09.427 --> 11:11.561
As far as Chadley knows,
this is where I live.

11:11.563 --> 11:12.962
Stewie, who owns
this place?

11:12.964 --> 11:14.931
Oh, just some rich idiot
I saw bragging

11:14.933 --> 11:16.799
about his vacation
on Instagram.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.235
He posted a picture
of his feet in sand.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.837
You're a guy,
don't do that.

11:20.839 --> 11:21.971
What a dick.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.740
Hey, I'll swallow
his dental floss.

11:23.742 --> 11:24.741
You pull it out of me

11:24.743 --> 11:25.742
and put it back
on the roll.

11:25.744 --> 11:26.743
Good call.

11:26.745 --> 11:27.744
(doorbell rings)

11:27.746 --> 11:29.012
Ah, that must be Chadley.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.314
Hi, Stewie.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.482
I love your house.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.616
Where are your servants?

11:33.618 --> 11:35.151
Oh, probably
cooking bananas

11:35.153 --> 11:36.586
and doing the
cha-cha-cha.

11:36.588 --> 11:38.955
You know, this is a
great house for a party.

11:38.957 --> 11:40.623
You could invite
the whole class.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.625
I-I say,
that's a brilliant idea!

11:42.627 --> 11:43.926
What the hell
are you doing?

11:43.928 --> 11:46.029
Relax, these people
are gone for a few more days.

11:46.031 --> 11:47.130
I'll invite everyone over

11:47.132 --> 11:49.365
and impress the whole
class in one shot.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.501
That'll cover my
playdates for a year.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.669
You really think
that'll work?

11:52.671 --> 11:53.770
Absolutely.

11:53.772 --> 11:55.838
And when it does,
I'll be as popular

11:55.840 --> 11:57.006
as the first kid in school

11:57.008 --> 11:58.508
to get his driver's license.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.044
Hey, heard you
got your license.

12:01.046 --> 12:02.178
(seductively):
Maybe after school,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.313
you could take me
to get some groceries?

12:04.315 --> 12:07.016
(seductively):
Yeah, or maybe you and me
hop in that car of yours

12:07.018 --> 12:08.985
and do some
grocery shopping?

12:08.987 --> 12:11.521
(seductively):
Looks like you have
a roomy backseat.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.824
I'd love to fill that
with groceries after school.

12:14.826 --> 12:16.325
Hey, it's Stewie.

12:16.327 --> 12:19.529
All I know about cars
is what my mom does.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.367
(knocking at door)

12:26.071 --> 12:27.503
Gretchen?!

12:27.505 --> 12:28.838
Wow, you look great!

12:28.840 --> 12:30.373
Yeah, I didn't have kids.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.741
Oh, yeah, of course,

12:31.743 --> 12:33.176
but what the hell
are you doing here?!

12:33.178 --> 12:34.844
I haven't seen
you in 20 years!

12:34.846 --> 12:37.046
Peter, I finally got
your letter.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.582
You know, the one where you said
that you were having doubts

12:39.584 --> 12:41.884
about marrying Lois
and you still had thoughts

12:41.886 --> 12:43.052
about marrying me.

12:43.054 --> 12:46.189
Gretchen, I wrote
that a long time ago.

12:46.191 --> 12:47.990
Well, my answer
is yes, Peter.

12:47.992 --> 12:50.359
Yes, I will marry you!

12:50.361 --> 12:52.195
Gretchen,
I am already happily--

12:52.197 --> 12:53.930
moderately hap--
relative-- I am--

12:53.932 --> 12:55.198
I am married.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.867
Oh, then I suppose your wife
is entitled to know

12:57.869 --> 12:59.502
that you were still
in love with me

12:59.504 --> 13:01.204
just days before your wedding.

13:01.206 --> 13:02.205
(Peter gasps)

13:02.207 --> 13:03.339
Blackmail!

13:03.341 --> 13:04.407
Thank you, Cleveland.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.075
And I don't know
what to call the thing

13:06.077 --> 13:07.276
you're doing to me, lady.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.052
Look, Gretchen,
I-I know I wrote you

13:16.054 --> 13:18.688
that letter, and-and-and
I meant it at the time, but...

13:18.690 --> 13:20.623
that was 20 years ago!

13:20.625 --> 13:22.925
I may have had some
doubts before my wedding,

13:22.927 --> 13:24.460
but what guy doesn't?

13:24.462 --> 13:25.628
And now I know

13:25.630 --> 13:27.864
I made the right choice
marrying Lois.

13:27.866 --> 13:30.233
(sighs)
Well, she's a lucky woman,

13:30.235 --> 13:31.868
and I'm sorry for what I said.

13:31.870 --> 13:34.470
I certainly don't want
to cause any trouble for you.

13:34.472 --> 13:36.439
It's just that when I got
this letter, it reminded me

13:36.441 --> 13:38.407
how sweet and funny
you always were.

13:38.409 --> 13:40.710
That's nice,
but I-I should go.

13:40.712 --> 13:42.411
Thanks for not making
fun of me for ordering

13:42.413 --> 13:43.446
a hot chocolate,

13:43.448 --> 13:45.114
and go ahead
and look into Facebook

13:45.116 --> 13:47.283
'cause this is kind of
what it's for.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.919
Wait, before we say
our final good-bye,

13:49.921 --> 13:52.388
what do you say we
have one last hurrah?

13:52.390 --> 13:53.589
I've got two tickets

13:53.591 --> 13:55.725
to a Ray LaMontagne
concert tonight.

13:55.727 --> 13:58.394
Oh, I-I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

13:58.396 --> 14:00.763
It feels a little weird
going out with another lady.

14:00.765 --> 14:03.900
Oh, come on, Peter,
I drove all this way.

14:03.902 --> 14:06.102
Let me go home
with one last good memory,

14:06.104 --> 14:08.171
and then I promise,
you have heard

14:08.173 --> 14:09.639
the last of Gretchen Mercer.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.741
Well, I should
probably say no,

14:11.743 --> 14:13.943
but I've never been
known for my good judgment.

14:13.945 --> 14:15.511
I mean, that's how
I got into trouble

14:15.513 --> 14:16.746
with the Peter Catcher.

14:16.748 --> 14:19.949
(bells ring)

14:19.951 --> 14:21.951
(singsongy):
Oh, Peter!

14:21.953 --> 14:23.986
Come and get your lollipops!

14:23.988 --> 14:25.121
Lollipops!

14:25.123 --> 14:27.156
Come along, Peter!

14:27.158 --> 14:28.791
(whispering):
Peter, you mustn't.

14:28.793 --> 14:31.127
I've got cream pies.

14:31.129 --> 14:32.795
Trinkle tarts.

14:32.797 --> 14:33.996
Trinkle tarts!

14:33.998 --> 14:37.266
(laughing)

14:37.268 --> 14:39.969
(laughs evilly)

14:39.971 --> 14:42.605
I'm gonna get so molested.

14:49.314 --> 14:52.114
Oh, Peter, you can take
off your hat and jacket.

14:52.116 --> 14:55.051
It's not illegal for two old
friends to go to a concert.

14:55.053 --> 14:56.285
Yeah, I guess you're right.

14:56.287 --> 14:58.020
I mean it's not like
anybody I know would be

14:58.022 --> 15:00.156
at a Ray LaMontagne concert.

15:00.158 --> 15:01.457
MAN:
Peter!

15:01.459 --> 15:02.491
Where'd he go?

15:02.493 --> 15:03.860
I'm-I'm gonna
keep the hat on.

15:03.862 --> 15:04.894
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

15:04.896 --> 15:06.028
This-this was a mistake.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.463
I just feel too guilty

15:07.465 --> 15:08.831
being out with another woman.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.333
I can't do this to Lois.

15:10.335 --> 15:12.335
Ah, I understand.

15:12.337 --> 15:13.336
(chuckles)

15:13.338 --> 15:14.904
Well, I guess there's no shame

15:14.906 --> 15:16.305
in coming in second, huh?

15:16.307 --> 15:17.306
That's right.

15:17.308 --> 15:19.408
Except in, like, wars.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.578
Aw, you are still
funny, sweet Peter.

15:22.580 --> 15:23.713
Yeah, I guess so.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.981
All right, I got to go.

15:24.983 --> 15:26.849
The beard inspector's
coming, anyway.

15:26.851 --> 15:28.551
Uh, sir, where's
your beard?

15:28.553 --> 15:29.819
I'm leaving.
I'm on my way out.

15:30.822 --> 15:33.022
That's my Peter.

15:33.024 --> 15:35.258
That's<i> my</i> Peter.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.797
(dance music plays)

15:44.235 --> 15:45.868
Wow, looks like
you're actually gonna

15:45.870 --> 15:47.003
get away with this, Stewie.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.938
(laughing):
And you threw a good party.

15:48.940 --> 15:50.539
Yeah, it's getting
pretty wild.

15:50.541 --> 15:51.574
Over in the guest bedroom

15:51.576 --> 15:53.376
there's a girl
pulling a train.

15:53.378 --> 15:55.544
This'll show my dad.

15:55.546 --> 15:57.380
Hey, by the way,
how'd you pay for all this?

15:57.382 --> 15:59.715
I dated Donald Sterling
for two weeks.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.250
He's a good man!

16:01.252 --> 16:03.853
You don't know him
like I know him!

16:03.855 --> 16:05.221
(children chattering)

16:05.223 --> 16:06.589
People.
People?

16:06.591 --> 16:09.859
As your rich host, I would
like to say a word if I may.

16:09.861 --> 16:13.262
I cannot tell you how pleased
I am to have finally found

16:13.264 --> 16:14.563
a group of peers with whom

16:14.565 --> 16:16.432
I share so many common
interests...

16:16.434 --> 16:18.634
(door opens)
and here come the people
who live here.

16:20.972 --> 16:22.405
Please let me explain!

16:22.407 --> 16:24.073
I was just worried
you wouldn't accept me

16:24.075 --> 16:25.274
because...

16:25.276 --> 16:27.243
I'm not wealthy
like you are.

16:27.245 --> 16:29.111
Stewie, it's not
that you're poor.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.914
It's that you lied
to us and you're poor.

16:31.916 --> 16:33.983
♪ ♪

16:37.255 --> 16:40.089
I'm sorry you lost your
rich friends, Stewie.

16:40.091 --> 16:42.291
Well, that's all right,
I don't need money.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.427
I already have
everything I need.

16:44.429 --> 16:47.129
Excuse me, is one
of you Chadley?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.065
You left your
wallet inside.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.067
Chicka-chickaw!

16:51.069 --> 16:52.768
Well, that "chicka-chickaw"

16:52.770 --> 16:54.937
makes me think
you're not Chadley.

16:54.939 --> 16:55.938
Oh, no!

16:55.940 --> 16:57.673
I chicka-chickawed
too early!

17:02.780 --> 17:04.947
Hey, Lois, you mind if
I cut out of here?

17:04.949 --> 17:06.248
Not at all.
Thanks.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.450
Not to be too intimate,

17:07.452 --> 17:09.118
but I need to have
a bowel movement

17:09.120 --> 17:10.453
and I can't go here.

17:10.455 --> 17:13.990
I can only go at home
or at the Koo Koo Roo.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.926
(door creaks)

17:16.928 --> 17:18.127
Hello?

17:18.129 --> 17:19.795
I-Is someone there?

17:19.797 --> 17:23.632
I thought I heard something
over the roar of my tinnitus.

17:23.634 --> 17:26.002
Oh, I'm-I'm sure it's nothing.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.011
(phone chimes)
Ooh, a text.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.480
"I'm taking care of our problem.

17:37.482 --> 17:38.881
"We'll be together soon.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.282
Love, Gretchen."

17:40.284 --> 17:41.484
Huh.

17:41.486 --> 17:43.319
Meg, you're kind of
a loner psychopath.

17:43.321 --> 17:45.187
What does this mean?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.656
Oh, this woman is
clearly a spurned lover

17:47.658 --> 17:48.891
who's planning to kill Mom.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.860
Ah, thank you.

17:50.862 --> 17:51.927
(whines nervously)

17:52.997 --> 17:54.330
You're a good dog, Meg.

17:54.332 --> 17:55.898
(whines nervously)

17:58.870 --> 18:01.637
Well, well, well...

18:01.639 --> 18:04.640
if it isn't the first
Mrs. Griffin.

18:04.642 --> 18:05.741
Gretchen?

18:05.743 --> 18:07.176
What are you doing here?

18:07.178 --> 18:09.245
Making sure Peter can
finally be with me,

18:09.247 --> 18:11.714
which is what
he's always wanted.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.883
Gretchen, it's 3:15
on a workday.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.351
The post office is closed.

18:15.353 --> 18:16.352
Lois!

18:16.354 --> 18:17.553
Gretchen wants to kill you,

18:17.555 --> 18:19.855
and I have a slip that
says we've got a package?

18:19.857 --> 18:22.024
Peter, I'm glad
you're here to see this.

18:22.026 --> 18:24.560
You and I can
finally be together.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.230
Peter, what's going on?!

18:28.232 --> 18:29.899
She's nuts is
what's going on!

18:29.901 --> 18:31.367
I don't want
to be with her!

18:31.369 --> 18:32.368
Oh, yeah?

18:32.370 --> 18:33.702
That's not
what you wrote.

18:33.704 --> 18:34.870
That's right.

18:34.872 --> 18:37.039
I lied about what
was in that letter.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.908
Lois, Lois,
before you read that,

18:38.910 --> 18:40.209
you need to know one thing:

18:40.211 --> 18:43.179
I'm the one throwing out
all your beige bras.

18:43.181 --> 18:45.481
Guys don't
like beige bras.

18:46.551 --> 18:47.716
You told an ex-girlfriend

18:47.718 --> 18:49.685
a week before our wedding

18:49.687 --> 18:51.053
you were having doubts?!

18:51.055 --> 18:52.254
Lois, Lois, listen to me.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.124
Yes, it is true,
just before we got married,

18:55.126 --> 18:56.725
I was having some doubts.

18:56.727 --> 18:59.028
I mean, your family hated me.

18:59.030 --> 19:01.130
I-I didn't think I was good
enough for you.

19:01.132 --> 19:03.232
We were kids, I was scared.

19:03.234 --> 19:04.400
Weren't you?

19:04.402 --> 19:05.935
No, I was in love,

19:05.937 --> 19:08.237
which is what I thought
you were, too.

19:08.239 --> 19:10.272
I was in love, Lois....

19:10.274 --> 19:11.540
and I still am.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.042
Not a day goes by where I don't

19:13.044 --> 19:14.910
thank my lucky stars
for picking you.

19:14.912 --> 19:16.812
It was the best choice
I ever made.

19:16.814 --> 19:18.747
Now, put that gun down,
Gretchen.

19:18.749 --> 19:20.082
You don't have to do this.

19:20.084 --> 19:21.917
That's right, you don't...

19:21.919 --> 19:23.419
because you can have him.

19:23.421 --> 19:24.553
What?!

19:24.555 --> 19:26.155
I'll never forgive you
for this, Peter.

19:26.157 --> 19:27.223
We're through!

19:28.259 --> 19:29.291
Oh, Peter!

19:29.293 --> 19:30.459
I can't wait
for you to meet

19:30.461 --> 19:32.661
the dogs and
the squirrels.

19:32.663 --> 19:34.263
LOIS:
Hey, Gretchen?

19:34.265 --> 19:35.664
(grunting)

19:36.801 --> 19:38.601
Get away from my husband.

19:38.603 --> 19:39.201
(grunts)

19:42.673 --> 19:44.607
Wait, so you're not mad?

19:44.609 --> 19:47.643
No, Peter, I was lying so
she'd let her guard down.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.411
But what about the letter?

19:49.413 --> 19:52.148
Peter, do you remember me
crying at our wedding?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.516
Sure, it's in
all our pictures.

19:53.518 --> 19:54.984
That's doubt.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.919
But there's no doubt anymore.

19:56.921 --> 19:59.622
You're the only man for me,
Peter Griffin.

19:59.624 --> 20:02.825
(sighing):
I love you, Lois.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.028
Oh, Peter!

20:06.030 --> 20:09.665
Now come on, let's get
it on through a P.O. box.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.000
LOIS:
Peter, this isn't working.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.168
Well, I'm at full go.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.435
Are you sure you're
in the right box?

20:13.437 --> 20:14.436
Yes.

20:14.438 --> 20:15.437
Box 528?

20:15.439 --> 20:16.972
Yes, 528.

20:16.974 --> 20:19.041
All right, just reach in
and grab it.

20:22.947 --> 20:24.680
Wow, Mom, I can't believe you

20:24.682 --> 20:26.782
got fired from the post office.

20:26.784 --> 20:28.851
Well, they didn't like
me beating up Gretchen

20:28.853 --> 20:30.219
on federal property,

20:30.221 --> 20:32.655
and then after your father
plugged up that P.O. box,

20:32.657 --> 20:34.790
there was a mutual
parting of the ways.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.492
Well, Stewie, I guess
since Lois lost her job,

20:36.494 --> 20:37.693
you're not going
to be able to go

20:37.695 --> 20:39.328
to that fancy
preschool anymore.

20:39.330 --> 20:40.329
Eh, I don't need school.

20:40.331 --> 20:41.330
I'll be fine.

20:41.332 --> 20:42.665
I'll just become
a YouTube star

20:42.667 --> 20:43.699
like Jenna Marbles.

20:43.701 --> 20:44.733
Who's that?

20:44.735 --> 20:45.868
No one knows,
but she's rich,

20:45.870 --> 20:48.204
as rich as
Ray William Johnson.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.339
Who's that?
Nobody knows,
but he's rich,

20:50.341 --> 20:52.141
as rich as Bethany Mota

20:52.143 --> 20:53.209
or Marcus Butler

20:53.211 --> 20:55.344
or Ingrid Nilsen.

20:55.346 --> 20:56.912
This?
This is over.
