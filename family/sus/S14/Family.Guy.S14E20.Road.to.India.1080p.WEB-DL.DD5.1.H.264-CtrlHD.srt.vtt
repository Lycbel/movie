WOMAN (Indian accent): Thank you
for holding. How can I help you?

00:59.444 --> 01:02.578
Well, for starters, you can keep
talking with that lovely accent.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.481
Amazing. One second of a
stranger's voice on a phone

01:05.483 --> 01:07.483

Your friend is correct.

I am in India.

But you sound like
a perfect gentleman to me.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.025
My name is Padma.

01:23.267 --> 01:25.034
is that I have too much money.
(chuckles)

01:25.036 --> 01:27.036
Then why don't you just
buy a new computer?

01:27.038 --> 01:28.270

Are you famous?

01:39.817 --> 01:41.283
By choice, no. No.

01:41.285 --> 01:43.519
Sometimes fame brings
a lot of unwanted attention.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.287
I mean, look at
William Shakespeare.

William Shakespeare.
Aye.

01:47.225 --> 01:48.657
Nice collar,

Thank ye.

01:49.660 --> 01:50.726
Hey, Shakespeare.

01:50.728 --> 01:52.228
What's the title
of your next play?

01:52.230 --> 01:55.297
You should call it
<i>Homosexual Collar Guy.</i>

01:55.299 --> 01:57.733
Ah, thy japes and jabs cut me
to the quick, squire.

01:57.735 --> 01:59.301
What does that
even mean?

01:59.303 --> 02:00.302
I know.

02:00.304 --> 02:01.871
It means, "I use
this collar as a bib

02:01.873 --> 02:03.339
for when I
service guys."

02:03.341 --> 02:05.141
Thank ye, thank ye.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.145

like the collar?

Hey, Peter. Good news.

02:32.737 --> 02:34.737
Bonnie's out of town,

02:34.739 --> 02:37.740

Why the hell would I
want to go to bingo?

02:39.243 --> 02:40.743
Oh, it's a blast.

02:40.745 --> 02:43.245
There's the thrill of the game,
people bring snacks,

02:43.247 --> 02:45.748
plus you'll hear some
pretty unfiltered opinions

02:45.750 --> 02:47.750
about those jokers
in Washington.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.952
Yeah, that sounds
perfectly terrible.

02:49.954 --> 02:51.187
You know what, Joe?

02:51.189 --> 02:52.955
Peter would love
to go with you.

02:52.957 --> 02:54.190
What?!
Terrific.

02:54.192 --> 02:56.358
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.293
What'd you do that for?!

02:57.295 --> 02:58.794
Peter, he's your friend.

02:58.796 --> 03:00.930
Who knows?
It might be fun.

03:00.932 --> 03:02.398
(sighs)
All right, I'll go.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.933
But I'm not happy.

03:03.935 --> 03:06.135
You know how much I hate
being told what to do.

03:06.137 --> 03:07.770

03:17.381 --> 03:19.815
You know, Padma,
I love Indian food.

03:19.817 --> 03:22.585
But I'd have to say my least
favorite curry is Ann.

03:22.587 --> 03:23.819
(chuckles)

03:23.821 --> 03:25.821
She's... she's
a newscaster here.

03:25.823 --> 03:27.823
I... I wish I could have
slipped that in earlier.

03:27.825 --> 03:29.058
PADMA:
Oh, no, I know her.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.060
She's internationally despised.

03:31.062 --> 03:33.062
So, are you done rebooting?

03:33.064 --> 03:35.331
Look, (sighs) uh,
I have to come clean.

03:35.333 --> 03:38.834

03:45.409 --> 03:46.408
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

03:46.410 --> 03:48.144
Oh, cool.
Ask her a question for me.

03:48.146 --> 03:50.412
How come over there
they just talk on the phone,

03:50.414 --> 03:51.847
and over here
they're all doctors?

03:51.849 --> 03:53.349
Get out of here. Lois
said you're supposed

03:53.351 --> 03:55.084
to sit on the potty
for one hour straight.

03:55.086 --> 03:56.852
I'm taking a break.
I got bored.

03:56.854 --> 03:58.787
And you've been on the phone
for more than an hour.

03:58.789 --> 04:00.356
I'm sorry.
Can you give me a sec?

04:00.358 --> 04:01.624
Look, I know it's crazy,

04:01.626 --> 04:03.626
but I honestly feel
a connection to this woman.

04:03.628 --> 04:05.995
More than I have
to anyone in a long time.

04:05.997 --> 04:08.197
That's nice, Brian, but
you're from different worlds.

04:08.199 --> 04:09.198
She's in India.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.432
That's a lot to overcome.

04:10.434 --> 04:12.201
People in love can
overcome anything.

04:12.203 --> 04:13.435
I guess you're right.

04:13.437 --> 04:15.771

Jeb Bush and his wife.

I'll ever be president?

You?

04:38.329 --> 04:39.628

Come on, I think
I see a cab

07:52.223 --> 07:54.289
with less than
nine people in it.

07:59.230 --> 08:01.096
All right,
it's winning time.

08:01.098 --> 08:02.564
Let's get this show
on the road.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.266
After all, it's not
called "bing-stop,"

08:04.268 --> 08:06.268
it's called "bing-go!"

08:06.270 --> 08:07.269
(laughing)

08:07.271 --> 08:08.570
That's very clever.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.572
Yeah, and, uh...
uh, maybe if I win,

08:10.574 --> 08:12.574
I'll yell, "bing-Joe."

08:12.576 --> 08:13.842
Don't force it, Joe.

08:13.844 --> 08:15.077
Yeah, be quiet, Joe.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.545

brought you here.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.382
Yeah, well, you
know something?

08:20.384 --> 08:21.850
The<i> Mayflower</i> also
brought fungus,

08:21.852 --> 08:23.552
which then became
the Potato Famine.

08:23.554 --> 08:25.053
What the hell are
you talking about?

08:25.055 --> 08:26.588
I don't know, I've had,
like, four Ensures.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.090
I'm out of my mind.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.592
Peter, I brought you here
to have fun, not take over.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.294
Look, Joe, I'm a
little busy right now,

08:32.296 --> 08:34.596
so I'm gonna have the Somali
pirate from<i> Captain Phillips</i>

08:34.598 --> 08:36.098
tell you something.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.100
Joe, look at me.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.601
Look at me.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.670
He is the bingo captain now.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.080
I tell you, I love
it here, Brian.

08:52.082 --> 08:53.582
The sounds,
the colors.

08:53.584 --> 08:54.883
You know, this is
where the Beatles came

08:54.885 --> 08:56.084
to ruin their music.

08:56.086 --> 08:57.085
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

08:57.087 --> 08:58.287
Anyway, Padma works
in Bangalore,

08:58.289 --> 09:00.155
so we got to hurry
and catch the train.

09:00.157 --> 09:02.591
(sighs) Can't believe
we're really in India.

09:02.593 --> 09:03.725
Oh, look over there.

09:03.727 --> 09:04.726
There's cute little
kids are playing

09:04.728 --> 09:06.395
Cowboys and Indians
and Indians.

09:06.397 --> 09:08.163
I'm gonna shoot you
with my six-gun.

09:08.165 --> 09:10.165
I'm gonna shoot you
with my bow and arrow.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.667
I'm just going to stand
here wearing a shirt

09:11.669 --> 09:13.669
that appears
to be a jacket.

09:13.671 --> 09:15.504
♪ ♪

09:21.078 --> 09:23.579
Do you think all those
chickens had to buy tickets?

09:23.581 --> 09:25.080
I don't know,
but I'm starving.

09:25.082 --> 09:27.916
What I wouldn't give right now
for a big juicy steak.

09:27.918 --> 09:29.151
How dare you?

09:29.153 --> 09:30.652
To us, cows
are sacred!

09:30.654 --> 09:32.654
That's right, you
are disrespecting

09:32.656 --> 09:34.156
our entire culture.

09:34.158 --> 09:37.326
And why did Wes Anderson come
here to make his worst movie?

09:37.328 --> 09:39.595
Stewie, what do we do?
Quick, hit the red buttons!

09:44.368 --> 09:46.168
Wow, that came in handy.
Yeah.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.936
Now let's get out of here.
Let's see what their
wieners look like.

09:47.938 --> 09:49.671
Yeah. Yeah, no,
let's get out of here.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.210
Okay, I'm off to bingo.

09:55.212 --> 09:56.445
Peter, what are
you wearing?

09:56.447 --> 09:58.213
Oh, you mean
my bingo cape?

09:58.215 --> 09:59.715
That's our holiday
tablecloth.

09:59.717 --> 10:02.217
I'm sorry, Lois, but my
people have come to expect

10:02.219 --> 10:04.219
a certain degree of pageantry.

10:04.221 --> 10:05.454
Don't wait up.

10:05.456 --> 10:06.722
We may go to Denny's.

10:06.724 --> 10:08.023
Is Joe going with you?

10:08.025 --> 10:09.558
Oh, "Crybaby Joe"?

10:09.560 --> 10:10.826
Nah, he doesn't come anymore.

10:10.828 --> 10:12.561
I think he resents my skill.

10:12.563 --> 10:14.463
Peter, bingo was
Joe's favorite thing.

10:14.465 --> 10:16.565
Now, you go over there
and take him with you,

10:16.567 --> 10:17.833
or I don't want
you going at all.

10:17.835 --> 10:19.835
Hey, hey, hey, don't try
to take this away from me.

10:19.837 --> 10:21.837
This is the only thing
I've ever been good at.

10:21.839 --> 10:24.806
Well, this and timing
my farts to a thunderstorm.

10:24.808 --> 10:26.708
Why don't we all go ahead and
turn to page six in the handout?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.710
(thunder crashes)
Ah...

10:28.712 --> 10:30.812
The first thing you're
gonna notice is a bar graph.

10:30.814 --> 10:33.582
And what that is is to indicate
our international sales,

10:33.584 --> 10:35.183
(thunder crashes)

10:35.185 --> 10:36.985
which peaked, of course,
during the last quarter.
Oh, yeah.

10:36.987 --> 10:39.221
But now we're expecting
that to drop off

10:39.223 --> 10:40.923
as we enter the
colder weather.

10:40.925 --> 10:42.925
(farts)

10:42.927 --> 10:44.760
(thunder crashes)

10:44.762 --> 10:46.595
The storm's moving away.

10:46.597 --> 10:48.664
(horn honking)
(indistinct chatter)

10:50.167 --> 10:51.700
(flies buzzing)

10:51.702 --> 10:52.834
We made it!

10:52.836 --> 10:54.169
This is where Padma works!

10:54.171 --> 10:57.606
I feel like I owe every bus
in America an apology.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.610
So, we haven't discussed
what you're going

11:01.612 --> 11:02.844
to do if she's a pig.

11:02.846 --> 11:04.179
She's already
beautiful to me.

11:04.181 --> 11:06.815
And you know,
we'll see.

11:12.022 --> 11:15.691
(indistinct chatter)

11:15.693 --> 11:17.526
My God, how you
gonna find her?

11:17.528 --> 11:19.027
There are hundreds
of people in here.

11:19.029 --> 11:21.396
Don't worry, I
thought of that.

11:21.398 --> 11:22.631
PADMA: Thank you
for calling tech support.

11:22.633 --> 11:23.899
How can I help you?

11:23.901 --> 11:24.967
I'll tell you how.

11:24.969 --> 11:26.068
Stand on your desk.

11:26.070 --> 11:27.102
Brian?

11:27.104 --> 11:28.670
Padma, just do it.

11:30.741 --> 11:31.873
Oh, boy.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.108
Are you Padma?

11:33.110 --> 11:34.710
No, I am Ranita.

11:34.712 --> 11:36.778
There is a python in my cube.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.449
Brian?

11:40.451 --> 11:41.416
Padma!

11:41.418 --> 11:42.718
I can't believe this!

11:42.720 --> 11:44.219
Why are you here?

11:44.221 --> 11:46.221
Because I was having
a technical issue

11:46.223 --> 11:47.889
with my heart.

11:47.891 --> 11:49.257
Ugh, 16 hours on a plane,

11:49.259 --> 11:50.993
and<i> that's</i> what you
came up with?

11:50.995 --> 11:53.629
I am touched you came
all this way to see me.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.063
I'm so glad I did.

11:55.065 --> 11:58.066
You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

12:00.504 --> 12:02.838
Well, I have to admit
you two do make a cute couple.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.008
But then again, so did Chris
Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.943
Do you take this woman
to lecture you

12:07.945 --> 12:10.746
about trans fats for as long
as you both shall live?

12:10.748 --> 12:11.913
I do.

12:11.915 --> 12:13.448
And do you take this man to be

12:13.450 --> 12:16.084
a watered-down Bono
until death do you part?

12:16.086 --> 12:17.285
I do.

12:17.287 --> 12:19.321
I now pronounce you
pretentious and terrible.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.324
You may name your daughter
after a fruit.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.692
(animals bleating)

12:23.694 --> 12:25.761
(indistinct chatter)

12:28.032 --> 12:29.598
So, this is my town.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.299
I have lived here
my whole life.

12:31.301 --> 12:33.869
Well, if you were born here,
then it must be a magical place.

12:33.871 --> 12:35.804
Yes, let's go get
sandwiches

12:35.806 --> 12:37.939
at that New Delhi
I keep hearing about.

12:37.941 --> 12:39.708
(plays two rimshots)

12:39.710 --> 12:41.777
Thanks, Ganesha.

12:41.779 --> 12:43.879
I am so happy
that you are here.

12:43.881 --> 12:46.982
In fact, my family is
having a big party tonight.

12:46.984 --> 12:49.051
You must both come
as my guests.

12:49.053 --> 12:50.719
Oh, an Indian party!

12:50.721 --> 12:52.821
I hope they play that one song
with the shrieking, nasal,

12:52.823 --> 12:56.291
atonal woman over the bongos
and tambourines.

12:56.293 --> 12:59.261
(woman singing atonally)

13:04.968 --> 13:06.001
You seem nervous.

13:06.003 --> 13:07.736
Are you worried
about meeting Padma's family?

13:07.738 --> 13:09.738
Yeah. Well, that,
and this is always

13:09.740 --> 13:11.339
what it looks
like on<i> Homeland</i>

13:11.341 --> 13:12.741
right before there's
a drone strike.

13:12.743 --> 13:15.644
Oh, my, you both
look so elegant.

13:15.646 --> 13:17.913
Thanks, I did a little
shopping today.

13:17.915 --> 13:19.347
Not me.
Mine is actually

13:19.349 --> 13:20.982
an Aladdin costume
from last Halloween.

13:20.984 --> 13:23.085
I never travel without it.

13:23.087 --> 13:24.820
(dinging)

13:24.822 --> 13:26.021
Family, guests,

13:26.023 --> 13:28.990
and monkeys who have
wandered in to steal fruit,

13:28.992 --> 13:32.594
it is my honor to welcome you
to this engagement celebration.

13:32.596 --> 13:33.662
Oh, "engagement"?

13:33.664 --> 13:34.930
So, who's getting married?

13:34.932 --> 13:35.997
I am.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.033
What?!

13:38.035 --> 13:40.001
Padma, my beloved daughter.

13:40.003 --> 13:42.104
Dhiraj, my future son-in-law.

13:42.106 --> 13:44.239
Please, come
and meet one another.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.108
Welp, that's a punjab
to the figs.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.909
Where's the bar?

13:49.213 --> 13:51.613
Everyone, you are all
so kind to come tonight,

13:51.615 --> 13:54.015
and it is so nice
to meet you, Dhiraj.

13:54.017 --> 13:57.953
But something happened today,
and I can no longer marry you.

13:57.955 --> 13:59.554
Padma, what is it?

13:59.556 --> 14:01.423
My true love is here tonight.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.792
He has come to me
all the way from America.

14:03.794 --> 14:05.927
His name is Brian Griffin.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.463
And my heart belongs to him.

14:08.465 --> 14:11.399
(all gasp)

14:11.401 --> 14:12.968
Quick, everyone's
looking at the dog!

14:12.970 --> 14:14.936
Go, go, go!

14:21.078 --> 14:23.712
Padma, you cannot
call off the wedding!

14:23.714 --> 14:26.982
I have already paid a large
dowry to Dhiraj's family!

14:26.984 --> 14:28.884
But it would be wrong
to marry someone I do not love.

14:28.886 --> 14:31.787
The one I love is Brian.

14:31.789 --> 14:34.623
Sir, what if I were to repay you
for all you've spent?

14:34.625 --> 14:37.225
Would Padma then be free
to marry whoever she wanted?

14:37.227 --> 14:38.593
(gasps)
Brian!

14:38.595 --> 14:39.795
You would do that?

14:39.797 --> 14:41.496
Yes.
I love you, Padma,

14:41.498 --> 14:43.999
and-and I'd do anything
to be with you.

14:44.001 --> 14:46.001
I suppose that
might be possible.

14:46.003 --> 14:47.836
Great, just give me
a chance to raise the money,

14:47.838 --> 14:49.805
so I can marry your daughter
and make her happy.

14:49.807 --> 14:52.607
Oh, so you don't
have the money?

14:52.609 --> 14:55.844
He's holding onto an Applebee's
gift card with $1.62 on it.

14:55.846 --> 14:57.746
I do not know
Applebee's.

14:57.748 --> 14:59.848
Is it like our
Colonel Chutney's?

14:59.850 --> 15:01.483
Does Colonel Chutney's
make you sick?

15:01.485 --> 15:02.684
Not every time.

15:02.686 --> 15:04.753
Then, no,
it's very different.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.258
I mean, my wife and I have
never said the words

15:10.260 --> 15:12.027
"open marriage," but...

15:12.029 --> 15:12.861
Oh, hey, Lois!

15:12.863 --> 15:14.963
Peter, it's time
to come home

15:14.965 --> 15:17.199
and give Joe back
his stupid little activity.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.301
I appreciate that,
Lois.

15:19.303 --> 15:20.635
First of all, this
is my favorite thing

15:20.637 --> 15:22.204
in the world now, so no.

15:22.206 --> 15:24.139
And second of all, we're
about to play a new round,

15:24.141 --> 15:25.307
so start taking
your pants off,

15:25.309 --> 15:26.942
'cause when I win,
I want you ready.

15:26.944 --> 15:28.510
Peter, if it wasn't for Joe,

15:28.512 --> 15:30.345
you wouldn't know
about bingo anyway.

15:30.347 --> 15:34.115
This meant everything to him,
and you've taken it away.

15:34.117 --> 15:36.117
As a friend, do the right thing

15:36.119 --> 15:39.054
and give Joe back
the happiness he found here.

15:39.056 --> 15:42.390
(sad music playing)

15:45.128 --> 15:48.096
Joe, gag on my fat dauber.

15:49.499 --> 15:51.132
Damn it, I didn't want
to have to do this,

15:51.134 --> 15:53.134
but you've left
me no choice!

15:53.136 --> 15:54.903
Kids, get in here!

15:54.905 --> 15:56.304
Yay! Time with Dad!

15:56.306 --> 15:59.040
That's a bingo for me!

15:59.042 --> 16:01.076
All right,
how do you play?

16:01.078 --> 16:02.477
"Free space"?!

16:02.479 --> 16:04.246
Wow! What's that about?!

16:04.248 --> 16:05.881
I call I sit
next to Dad!

16:05.883 --> 16:06.982
(sighs)

16:06.984 --> 16:07.983
All right, forget this.

16:07.985 --> 16:09.251
Let's all go home and each do

16:09.253 --> 16:11.319
our own individual media things.

16:17.494 --> 16:18.927
Stewie, I don't think
this is gonna work.

16:18.929 --> 16:20.695
We're never gonna
raise enough money

16:20.697 --> 16:22.097
to pay back
Padma's father.

16:22.099 --> 16:24.065
Trust me, Brian, there are
a billion people here,

16:24.067 --> 16:26.167
and almost every one
of them has a tapeworm.

16:26.169 --> 16:28.003
Yes, excuse me,
I have a tapeworm.

16:28.005 --> 16:30.005
All right, very good.
Lie down on your stomach.

16:30.007 --> 16:32.073
This won't hurt a bit.

16:38.115 --> 16:40.015
Hey, how are you guys?

16:40.017 --> 16:41.082
Oh, you're a lady.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.350
And you sound
American.

16:42.352 --> 16:43.952
How long have you
been in there?

16:43.954 --> 16:45.754
I originally just came
for my junior year,

16:45.756 --> 16:48.957
but I fell in love
with the place.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.192
Stewie, there's no way
I'm sitting here all day

16:51.194 --> 16:53.028
watching tapeworms
come out of butts.

16:53.030 --> 16:54.930
I'm doomed.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.132
I'll never be able
to pay for Padma's dowry.

16:57.134 --> 16:58.366
I don't understand.

16:58.368 --> 17:00.869
In movies, everything in India
always turns out great.

17:00.871 --> 17:03.605
Julia Roberts ate or loved
or prayed or something.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.140
I don't, I don't know.
I didn't see it.

17:05.142 --> 17:06.241
Wait a minute!

17:28.665 --> 17:30.565
STEWIE:
He's breaking up a marriage!

17:30.567 --> 17:34.169
All right, let's get started.

17:34.171 --> 17:37.172
First question--
"Which retired Indian cricketer

17:37.174 --> 17:39.441
"has scored over
18,000 runs

17:39.443 --> 17:41.276
in ODI competition?"

17:41.278 --> 17:43.111
Um, O...?
Wha...?

17:43.113 --> 17:45.280
O-ODI?
What?

17:45.282 --> 17:47.682
Is it A) Anil Kumble,

17:47.684 --> 17:50.585
B) Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

17:50.587 --> 17:53.588
C) Sachin Tendulkar,

17:53.590 --> 17:56.257
or D) Jiminy Cricket?

17:56.259 --> 17:59.027
Well, I know, I know
it's not Jiminy Cricket.

17:59.029 --> 18:02.163
Unless Jiminy's
based on a real person.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.498
I need an answer.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.599
You know, the more I say it,

18:04.601 --> 18:06.267
the more it does sound Indian.

18:06.269 --> 18:07.202
(Indian accent):
Jiminy Cricket.

18:07.204 --> 18:10.271
D) Jiminy Cricket, final answer.

18:12.809 --> 18:14.709
I'm sorry,
that is incorrect.

18:14.711 --> 18:16.144
Thank you for playing!

18:16.146 --> 18:17.445
We'll be right back

18:17.447 --> 18:20.148
after this message
from the Indian Census Bureau.

18:20.150 --> 18:21.049
Too many people!

18:21.051 --> 18:23.118
Stop with the people!

18:26.056 --> 18:27.689
Padma, I'm sorry.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.224
I still haven't
raised the money.

18:29.226 --> 18:30.058
But I'm working on it.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.726
There is no longer a need.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.228
My father has
solved the problem

18:33.230 --> 18:36.164
by promising Dhiraj
the hand of my younger sister.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.166
Oh, Padma, I meant
to ask you, are there, like,

18:38.168 --> 18:40.135
Bengal tigers just
running loose in the cities?

18:40.137 --> 18:41.603
I don't know.

18:41.604 --> 18:43.070
In America, are there
annoying talking babies

18:43.073 --> 18:44.672
always interrupting?

18:44.674 --> 18:46.674
Okay, it's been
a long trip.

18:46.676 --> 18:49.177
Let's not say anything
we're gonna regret.

18:49.179 --> 18:51.079
Wait a minute, so if,
if Dhiraj is marrying

18:51.081 --> 18:53.081
your sister, that means
we can be together!

18:53.083 --> 18:55.150
Actually, about that.

18:55.152 --> 18:58.086
I think watching you try to
answer that question out there,

18:58.088 --> 19:00.088
I realized something.

19:00.090 --> 19:02.257
You know nothing
of my country or my culture.

19:02.259 --> 19:04.159
Well, tha-that was a
really tough question.

19:04.161 --> 19:05.527
No, it wasn't.

19:05.529 --> 19:09.097
Everyone in India knows
who Sachin Tendulkar is.

19:09.099 --> 19:12.200
Brian, I am deeply touched
that you came all this way

19:12.202 --> 19:14.436
to find me,
but the truth is, you and I

19:14.438 --> 19:16.337
have very little in common.

19:16.339 --> 19:17.272
Well, I could learn!

19:17.274 --> 19:19.174
I mean, I mean,
there's got to be

19:19.176 --> 19:21.376
an old<i> Carmen Sandiego</i> episode
on India or something.

19:21.378 --> 19:23.745
STEWIE:
Brian, Brian, punt, punt.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.280
I know you would try,
Brian.

19:25.282 --> 19:27.015
But when I look
inside myself,

19:27.017 --> 19:29.350
I realize I do not
want to marry you.

19:29.352 --> 19:32.087
Mostly, I just did not
want to marry Dhiraj.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.955
I am so sorry.

19:33.957 --> 19:36.925
Have I answered all of your
questions to your satisfaction?

19:36.927 --> 19:39.360
No! I came halfway
around the world for you!

19:39.362 --> 19:40.762
You said I was your true love!

19:40.764 --> 19:42.197
Well, by coming here,

19:42.199 --> 19:44.599
you saved me from a lifetime
of unhappiness.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.702
And I will always
love you for that.

19:47.704 --> 19:49.771
Good-bye, Brian.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.808
A peck on the cheek?

19:53.810 --> 19:56.111
Was that worth
an $8,000 coach ticket?

19:56.113 --> 19:57.278
You know what?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.247
It's about the journey,
not the destination.

19:59.249 --> 20:00.482
No, it's not.

20:00.484 --> 20:02.250
This sucked
and you failed.
