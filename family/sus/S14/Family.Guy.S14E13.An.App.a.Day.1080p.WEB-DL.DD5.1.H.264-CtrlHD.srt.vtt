("Around the World"
by Daft Punk playing)

00:38.364 --> 00:41.098
Oh, cool, somebody put
Billy Joel on the jukebox.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.500
Billy Joel?
This is Daft Punk.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.369
Dappunk?
Wh-- I-- What is that?

00:45.371 --> 00:46.636
That's not even words.

00:46.638 --> 00:48.205
What are you saying?
This is Billy Joel.

00:48.207 --> 00:50.207
It's "Anthony's Song,"
parentheses, "Movin' Out."

00:50.209 --> 00:53.377
First of all, it's "Movin' Out,"
parentheses, "Anthony's Song."

00:53.379 --> 00:56.179
And second of all,
this is 100% not Billy Joel!

00:56.181 --> 00:58.048
You know, when they
recorded "Movin' Out,"

00:58.050 --> 00:59.883
someone left the
studio doors open,

00:59.885 --> 01:02.285
and that's why, at the end,
you hear that car sound.

01:02.287 --> 01:04.621
That's not true either!
No, this is it.

01:04.623 --> 01:06.556
He's talking about going
all around the world

01:06.558 --> 01:08.392
'cause this Anthony fella,
he's moving out.

01:08.394 --> 01:10.060
You know, to live
with Mr. Cacciatore

01:10.062 --> 01:11.395
down on Mulberry Street.

01:11.397 --> 01:13.730
And that's all I'm gonna
say about those two.

01:13.732 --> 01:15.532
Peter, I'm gonna punch
you with this beer mug

01:15.534 --> 01:16.800
till I'm holding
just the handle!

01:16.802 --> 01:18.068
Guys, calm down.

01:18.070 --> 01:19.636
There's one way
to solve this.

01:19.638 --> 01:20.971
I'll just use my phone.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.639
(phone beeps,
song continues playing)

01:22.641 --> 01:24.741
It says "'Around the World'
by Daft Punk."

01:24.743 --> 01:26.076
Thank you!

01:26.078 --> 01:27.544
God, you idiots are exhausting.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.012
Hey, Cleveland, how'd you
do that with your phone?

01:29.014 --> 01:30.247
I'm not an idiot.

01:30.249 --> 01:31.748
I used Shazam.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.984
It recognizes songs and
tells you their names.

01:33.986 --> 01:35.819
Yeah? Hey, what if
I farted into it?

01:35.821 --> 01:38.055
I don't know.
Be my guest.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.524
(farts loudly)

01:40.526 --> 01:42.359
It says "Lana Del Rey."

01:42.361 --> 01:44.027
Wow, how do I get
this on my phone?

01:44.029 --> 01:45.262
You just download it.

01:45.264 --> 01:46.696
It's a app.
What's an app?

01:46.698 --> 01:48.098
They're little programs

01:48.100 --> 01:49.766
you use on your phone
while driving.

01:49.768 --> 01:51.601
Oh, man,
apps sound awesome!

01:51.603 --> 01:53.170
This is a real
game changer!

01:53.172 --> 01:54.538
Like the guy who invented

01:54.540 --> 01:56.273
wearing a sport jacket
with jeans.

01:56.275 --> 01:57.441
So, what can
I do for you?

01:57.443 --> 01:58.875
Well, I've got
to go to church,

01:58.877 --> 02:00.777
but I don't have time
to change from the rodeo.

02:00.779 --> 02:02.846
Excuse me, I thought
you were helping me find a look

02:02.848 --> 02:04.781
that'll let me cling
to my youth in my 40s.

02:04.783 --> 02:06.016
Yes, I'm interested

02:06.018 --> 02:07.918
in cheating on my wife
in Las Vegas.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.254
Gentlemen, I think I can
help all three of you.

02:14.726 --> 02:16.560
Brian, I'm in a bind.

02:16.562 --> 02:18.361
Joanne was supposed to
drive me to the club,

02:18.363 --> 02:19.796
but she's having
throat surgery.

02:19.798 --> 02:21.731
20 years of
menthol slims.

02:21.733 --> 02:23.400
I don't understand
anything you just said.

02:23.402 --> 02:25.035
Just drive me to
the racquet club.

02:25.037 --> 02:26.970
Since when do you belong
to a racquet club?

02:26.972 --> 02:29.272
You know, I do have a life
outside this house.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.808
For example, I also write
restaurant reviews

02:31.810 --> 02:34.377
for the newspaper
under the name Hugh Cornwallis.

02:34.379 --> 02:36.146
Hugh Cornwallis?
He's, like...

02:36.148 --> 02:38.048
Super bitchy, I know.
Now come on, let's go.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.883
So, what? You're gonna
play tennis all day?

02:39.885 --> 02:41.551
No, I might also
hit the treadmill

02:41.553 --> 02:42.819
and watch
<i>Kelly and Michael</i>

02:42.821 --> 02:44.654
on mute with
closed captioning.

02:44.656 --> 02:46.890
"Kelly: It's like kale

02:46.892 --> 02:48.992
"is everywhere these days,
am I right?

02:48.994 --> 02:50.494
Michael: unintelligible."

02:50.496 --> 02:51.895
I love them.

02:51.897 --> 02:54.131
They have such
an amazing chemistry.

02:59.104 --> 03:00.504
Yeah!

03:00.506 --> 03:01.738
Awesome!

03:01.740 --> 03:03.173
Peter, will you
keep it down?

03:03.175 --> 03:05.008
I'm trying to look at
lamps I'll never buy.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.610
Oh, yeah, sorry.

03:06.612 --> 03:08.578
Sweet!
What are you doing?

03:08.580 --> 03:10.514
Well, I just found out about
these things called apps,

03:10.516 --> 03:12.282
so that's kind of
all I do now.

03:12.284 --> 03:14.751
This one's a cool
bowling app I got.

03:14.753 --> 03:16.353
Aw, yeah, strike!

03:16.355 --> 03:18.688
Peter, your phone's
streaming to the TV.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.257
You're clearly
watching porn.

03:20.259 --> 03:21.758
Will you turn it off?

03:21.760 --> 03:23.426
I'm already caught, Lois.
I'm gonna finish.

03:23.428 --> 03:24.861
Peter, I'm...
I'm gonna finish!

03:24.863 --> 03:26.630
Just go over there!

03:26.632 --> 03:29.332
We're gonna be fine,
Lois, you and me.

03:33.539 --> 03:35.105
There you are, Dad.

03:35.107 --> 03:37.274
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in days.

03:37.276 --> 03:39.209
Ugh. I went out of town
for a little while,

03:39.211 --> 03:40.610
but I made the
mistake of using

03:40.612 --> 03:42.445
this app called
Bear B'n'B.

03:42.447 --> 03:44.214
We're so happy you're
staying with us.

03:44.216 --> 03:47.217
Just a reminder, we ask that
you not use the DVD player,

03:47.219 --> 03:49.119
but you can watch
any of the VHSs.

03:49.121 --> 03:50.287
We have<i> Clear and</i>
<i>Present Danger,</i>

03:50.289 --> 03:51.721
<i>Son of the Mask...</i>

03:51.723 --> 03:53.323
oh, and here's
most of a puzzle.

03:53.325 --> 03:55.225
Okay, well, I don't
want any of that stuff.

03:55.227 --> 03:56.693
Fine. Well,
if the phone rings

03:56.695 --> 03:58.295
and we're not around,
just take a message.

03:58.297 --> 03:59.796
I'm kind of on vacation.

03:59.798 --> 04:02.632
Oh, and just a heads up,
the dog doesn't like men.

04:02.634 --> 04:05.302
Now, we serve breakfast from
6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

04:05.304 --> 04:06.636
I'll skip breakfast.

04:06.638 --> 04:07.971
Uh, everyone
eats breakfast.

04:07.973 --> 04:09.372
I'm on vacation.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.807
All the more reason
to treat yourself.

04:10.809 --> 04:13.143
The house specialty
is a half-chewed trout

04:13.145 --> 04:15.145
we yanked out of the
river with our teeth.

04:15.147 --> 04:16.880
Ah, there's the bear stuff.

04:20.319 --> 04:21.384
(phone chimes)

04:23.055 --> 04:24.254
Where are you going?

04:24.256 --> 04:25.555
Oh, I'm meeting up
with someone

04:25.557 --> 04:26.990
from my Grinder app.

04:26.992 --> 04:28.425
Isn't that for
anonymous gay hookups?

04:28.427 --> 04:30.360
No, no, no.
This one's a way for guys

04:30.362 --> 04:32.262
who enjoy sandwiches
to connect.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.832
MAN:
You "Meatballfreak"?

04:35.834 --> 04:36.766
Uh-huh.

04:36.768 --> 04:38.235
All right,
let's do this.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.174
Are you also married?

04:48.947 --> 04:50.213
My phone's broken.

04:50.215 --> 04:51.448
I'm not surprised.

04:51.450 --> 04:52.949
It's probably because
of all those apps

04:52.951 --> 04:54.451
you've been downloading.

04:54.453 --> 04:56.253
Don't say "apps"
like you're young.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.554
No, I took it
in the shower

04:57.556 --> 04:59.122
'cause I didn't know
you could pause a game.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.357
Here, Chris.
Your first cell phone!

05:00.359 --> 05:01.625
Yay!

05:01.627 --> 05:03.960
Something my dad held
in the bathroom!

05:03.962 --> 05:06.363
You know, Chris, you could
probably salvage that phone.

05:06.365 --> 05:09.199
If you put it in a bag of
uncooked rice, it'll dry out.

05:09.201 --> 05:10.133
Really?

05:10.135 --> 05:11.801
Yeah. And then you
can use the rice

05:11.803 --> 05:13.803
to pretend someone
wanted to marry you.

05:13.805 --> 05:15.305
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:15.307 --> 05:18.875
Mr. and Mrs. Dog
and Meg the Bounty Hunter!

05:27.219 --> 05:28.952
Holy moley!

05:28.954 --> 05:30.320
Marcy Miller!

05:30.322 --> 05:32.222
She bought feminine products
at my dad's pharmacy,

05:32.224 --> 05:34.457
so you know
she's up and running.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.793
Yeah, I wish I had
the guts to talk to her.

05:36.795 --> 05:37.961
Talk to her?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.896
Chris, no one talks
to each other anymore.

05:39.898 --> 05:41.498
If you want to get
a girl's attention,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.566
you text her a picture
of your penis.

05:43.568 --> 05:44.901
What? Really?

05:44.903 --> 05:46.403
Are-Are you sure?
Oh, yeah.

05:46.405 --> 05:48.071
People who send their daughters
to public high schools

05:48.073 --> 05:49.572
are basically
asking for this.

05:49.574 --> 05:52.809
Well, I did just get
this new phone from my dad.

05:55.580 --> 05:56.579
(camera clicks)

05:56.581 --> 05:58.014
All right, what could go wrong?

05:58.016 --> 05:59.349
It worked out great for...

05:59.351 --> 06:01.484
("Yakety Sax" playing)

06:11.430 --> 06:12.996
Ah. This is it, Bri.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.864
The Quahog Racquet Club.

06:14.866 --> 06:18.601
Where frail old men come
to weigh themselves in the nude.

06:18.603 --> 06:22.138
Does that say 84 or 85?

06:22.140 --> 06:23.940
It says 63.

06:23.942 --> 06:25.375
Oh, dear.

06:25.377 --> 06:27.911
How'd you get all those
cuts on your butt?

06:29.281 --> 06:31.715
Wow, they allow drinking here
at 10:30 in the morning?

06:31.717 --> 06:34.651
Oh, yes, half the bathroom trash
is thrown-up scrambled eggs.

06:34.653 --> 06:36.453
Okay, so this place
has hot women,

06:36.455 --> 06:38.621
morning booze
and free vomit?

06:38.623 --> 06:40.623
Maybe I'll join you.
You don't play tennis.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.659
What are you talking about?
I'm a great tennis player.

06:42.661 --> 06:44.227
You are? Well, that's perfect.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.562
There's a doubles tournament
coming up,

06:45.564 --> 06:47.130
and I could really
use a partner.

06:47.132 --> 06:48.465
Well, you found him!

06:48.467 --> 06:50.834
All right, all right,
I suppose we can make this work.

06:50.836 --> 06:52.369
Like that actress
from<i> Rizzoli & Isles</i>

06:52.371 --> 06:53.837
and her husband do.

06:53.839 --> 06:55.805
Honey, I thought
we could do

06:55.807 --> 06:57.307
a little
role-playing tonight.

06:57.309 --> 06:59.309
Oh, yeah? What'd
you have in mind?

06:59.311 --> 07:01.678
Maybe I could be
my character from the show.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.146
Oh! Yeah!

07:03.148 --> 07:04.514
From the show!

07:04.516 --> 07:05.548
Sure.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.250
Um... oh, no!

07:07.252 --> 07:09.519
It's the... law
enforcement woman.

07:09.521 --> 07:12.021
Part of that great team
of Rizzoli and Isles.

07:12.023 --> 07:13.890
You don't know
what part I play, do you?

07:13.892 --> 07:16.259
Hey, look, you didn't marry me
because of my brains.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.594
You married me
because I play

07:17.596 --> 07:19.696
one of the main bad
guys in<i> Blue Bloods.</i>

07:19.698 --> 07:23.066
Now let's just stop talking
and have idiot actor sex.

07:27.005 --> 07:28.905
Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.740
We've got a bit
of a situation,

07:30.742 --> 07:33.042
which is why I've asked
Officer Swanson to join us.

07:33.044 --> 07:35.545
It appears Chris sent an
inappropriate photo of himself

07:35.547 --> 07:37.013
to one of his
classmates.

07:37.015 --> 07:37.947
That's right.

07:37.949 --> 07:39.849
He texted a picture
of his peenie.

07:39.851 --> 07:41.017
Oh, my God!

07:41.019 --> 07:43.086
And apparently the girl...
Oh, thank God.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.355
...he sent it to
doesn't like him back,

07:45.357 --> 07:46.756
so she turned him in.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.192
Okay, I can see
everybody's mad, but...

07:49.194 --> 07:50.860
what'd you think?

07:50.862 --> 07:52.228
Thank you for
bringing this

07:52.230 --> 07:53.863
to our attention,
Principal Shepherd.

07:53.865 --> 07:56.032
We'll make sure
Chris apologizes

07:56.034 --> 07:57.567
to that little
knob-tease.

07:57.569 --> 07:59.736
I'm sorry, Lois,
but it's not that simple.

07:59.738 --> 08:01.571
When Chris sent
that picture,

08:01.573 --> 08:04.874
he was technically
distributing child pornography.

08:04.876 --> 08:06.643
Child pornography?!

08:06.645 --> 08:08.144
Joe, that's crazy!

08:08.146 --> 08:10.747
He's just a teenager
who made a bad choice.

08:10.749 --> 08:13.883
I don't know what to say, but
the laws just haven't caught up

08:13.885 --> 08:15.552
to how cool kids are now.

08:15.554 --> 08:17.954
I'm sorry, but this makes Chris
a sex offender.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.289
Oh, my God!

08:19.291 --> 08:20.590
Huh.

08:20.592 --> 08:23.126
Well, I'm not about to make
a Batman exit right now,

08:23.128 --> 08:25.628
but has that thing
always been over there?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.096
Over where?

08:27.098 --> 08:28.398
What are you doing, Peter?

08:28.400 --> 08:29.966
Ah, you looked back
too fast.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.075
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

08:39.077 --> 08:42.111
Today, we bring you a disturbing
case of child pornography.

08:42.113 --> 08:44.414
Local teenage scumbag
Chris Griffin,

08:44.416 --> 08:46.082
whose name will be omitted here,

08:46.084 --> 08:47.750
was caught sending,
quote-unquote,

08:47.752 --> 08:49.452
"graphic selfies of his hog"--

08:49.454 --> 08:51.254
not sure where
that quote is from--

08:51.256 --> 08:53.089
to another underage student.

08:53.091 --> 08:56.793
Coming up next, teleprompter guy
puts the period in a weird.

08:56.795 --> 08:58.361
Place.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.929
Oh, this is awful.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.599
Now everyone in town
knows I'm a sex offender!

09:02.601 --> 09:04.534
We know you didn't
mean any harm, Chris.

09:04.536 --> 09:06.269
We're just living
in a different time.

09:06.271 --> 09:07.770
When I was your age,

09:07.772 --> 09:09.806
boys used to just
whip it out on the bus.

09:09.808 --> 09:12.442
Can't I just go on the news
and tell everyone I'm sorry?

09:12.444 --> 09:14.210
Oh, I wish you
could, sweetie,

09:14.212 --> 09:16.546
but the law says that,
as a sex offender,

09:16.548 --> 09:18.982
you have to complete
a rehabilitation course.

09:18.984 --> 09:20.950
Oh, that sounds awful.

09:20.952 --> 09:23.386
Eh, can't be any worse
than our trip to Hawaii.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.822
Okay, before you do
anything else,

09:25.824 --> 09:28.157
I'm deathly allergic
to pineapple, pork,

09:28.159 --> 09:29.792
rum, macadamia nuts,

09:29.794 --> 09:32.128
stupid tiny guitars,
overpriced golf,

09:32.130 --> 09:34.330
sentimental
military stuff, lava,

09:34.332 --> 09:36.366
people who I can't tell
are black or Asian,

09:36.368 --> 09:38.635
apostrophes,
anyone twirling flames,

09:38.637 --> 09:40.470
second weddings
and linen pants.

09:40.472 --> 09:42.305
Is there anything
you're not allergic to?

09:42.307 --> 09:43.640
Yeah, the Epcot Center.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.909
Where I<i> wanted</i> to go.

09:49.648 --> 09:52.148
Good evening, I'm Glenn
Quagmire, your instructor.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.650
Everyone look to your left.

09:53.652 --> 09:55.151
Now look to your right.

09:55.153 --> 09:56.986
All of you are sex offenders,

09:56.988 --> 09:59.222
and statistically
you will all be here again.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.225
Because this has never worked
in the history of doing this.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.094
Now, today, we have a new
member-- giggity-- Chris G.

10:05.096 --> 10:06.663
ALL:
Hi, Chris.

10:06.665 --> 10:07.830
All right, before we begin,

10:07.832 --> 10:09.332
whoever's driving
a windowless van

10:09.334 --> 10:11.401
painted like an ice cream truck,
your lights are on.

10:13.939 --> 10:15.939
Okay, next,
let's take a few minutes

10:15.941 --> 10:17.907
to talk about
our new, fake interests.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.609
Here's a clay pot I made.

10:19.611 --> 10:21.678
I've started following
girls' field hockey.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.779
No, come on.

10:22.781 --> 10:24.514
You're supposed to pick
from the list.

10:24.516 --> 10:26.716
Mr. Quagmire,
this is terrible.

10:26.718 --> 10:28.952
And do I really
have to be here?

10:28.954 --> 10:30.753
Well, the law does
give you a choice.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.121
This or chemical
castration.

10:32.123 --> 10:34.123
What's that?
You take a
ton of pills

10:34.125 --> 10:35.959
that completely wipe
out all sexuality.

10:35.961 --> 10:37.694
Oh, is that what
Michael Moore did?

10:37.696 --> 10:39.629
No, but I understand
why you'd think that.

10:39.631 --> 10:41.531
Now, do you want
to see the list?

10:41.533 --> 10:43.900
I could take a whack at
hand-distressing furniture.

10:43.902 --> 10:45.602
We don't say "whack."

10:52.043 --> 10:54.110
(grunting loudly)

11:00.719 --> 11:01.784
Very good, Stewie.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.553
You grunt like
a Hungarian lesbian.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.054
(sighs)
Thanks, Dimitri.

11:05.056 --> 11:07.624
And, uh, your testicle's hanging
out of your shorts again.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.958
I am cooling it.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.793
But where is
this partner of yours?

11:10.795 --> 11:13.262
I don't know. He was supposed
to be here 15 minutes ago.

11:13.264 --> 11:14.998
(laughter)
You're right.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.432
So, anyway,
my ex said,

11:16.434 --> 11:18.401
"If you bring home
one more tennis trophy,

11:18.403 --> 11:19.802
I am out of here."

11:19.804 --> 11:21.237
Well, she was gone
in two days.

11:21.239 --> 11:23.239
(laughter)

11:23.241 --> 11:24.507
Oh, Brian.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.643
"O'Brien"?
That's my Irish cousin.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.078
(laughter)

11:29.080 --> 11:30.346
What are you doing?!

11:30.348 --> 11:32.148
We're supposed to be
practicing for the tournament.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.983
Stewie, relax.
I promise we'll practice,

11:33.985 --> 11:35.351
but we just ordered bisque.

11:35.353 --> 11:36.619
How are you
paying for that?

11:36.621 --> 11:38.087
Well, if you must know,

11:38.089 --> 11:40.089
we're putting it on Philippa's
husband's account.

11:40.091 --> 11:41.591
Does Burt know
about this?

11:41.593 --> 11:43.526
He would if he wasn't
working all the time.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.528
Thank you, Brian.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.264
Now, come on, let's have more
hard liquor and creamy soups.

11:48.266 --> 11:49.766
Ugh.

11:53.438 --> 11:55.872
Meg, can you hand me
the paper plates?

11:55.874 --> 11:57.940
I can't believe we're
having an ice cream cake

11:57.942 --> 12:00.309
to celebrate Chris graduating
from sex offender school.

12:00.311 --> 12:02.311
Well, the opportunities
to celebrate

12:02.313 --> 12:04.113
don't come often
in this household.

12:04.115 --> 12:07.984
There he is, Mr.
Former Sex Offender.

12:07.986 --> 12:09.719
But Mom, it's not
that big a deal.

12:09.721 --> 12:11.821
All I did was finish
those creepy classes.

12:11.823 --> 12:13.956
I know, but now your
record is clear.

12:13.958 --> 12:16.292
You can go back to
being a normal boy

12:16.294 --> 12:18.061
and put all this
behind you.

12:18.063 --> 12:19.729
Hey, Chris, wait till
you see the funny thing

12:19.731 --> 12:21.497
I had 'em put
on your cake.

12:21.499 --> 12:23.700
"Happy sixth
birthday, Timmy"?

12:23.702 --> 12:25.368
Uh-oh, they must
have mixed them up.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.204
"Nice crank,
you dirty little bastard"?

12:28.206 --> 12:29.472
Sorry, I'll take that.

12:29.474 --> 12:31.708
Here's your cake.
I ate a great deal of it.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.147
Oh, there you are.

12:38.149 --> 12:39.882
How was your first
day out of rehab?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.350
It was terrible.

12:41.352 --> 12:43.152
Taking that class
made no difference.

12:43.154 --> 12:45.321
Nobody wants anything
to do with me.

12:45.323 --> 12:46.556
Hi, Mr. Herbert.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.523
Oh, my God.

12:47.525 --> 12:48.524
Children, run!

12:48.526 --> 12:49.926
It's that pervert!

12:49.928 --> 12:51.194
Everybody into my
safety basement!

12:51.196 --> 12:52.261
(boys gasping, shouting)

12:52.263 --> 12:53.262
(sharp snap)
Oh!

12:53.264 --> 12:54.831
Oh, that
was a bad snap.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.199
I'm hurt, kids!

12:56.201 --> 12:59.302
Don't eat those popsicles
till I get down there!

13:04.008 --> 13:06.375
Well, I'm glad we're finally
getting some practice in.

13:06.377 --> 13:07.944
Yeah, nothing like
running around

13:07.946 --> 13:10.446
after eating
a seafood tower.

13:10.448 --> 13:11.881
What are you
doing here?

13:11.883 --> 13:13.282
You're supposed to
be at the baseline.

13:13.284 --> 13:14.684
Yeah, baseline,
baseline.

13:14.686 --> 13:16.552
Right, right.
He's serving to you.

13:16.554 --> 13:17.687
Get back there!

13:20.091 --> 13:21.190
(grunts)

13:23.762 --> 13:25.394
You've never played
tennis, have you?

13:25.396 --> 13:26.796
Not once.
Damn it, Brian!

13:26.798 --> 13:28.231
I entered us in
that tournament

13:28.233 --> 13:29.632
because you said
you could play!

13:29.634 --> 13:31.033
And I will not
be humiliated

13:31.035 --> 13:33.536
in front of shallow,
rich alcoholics!

13:37.475 --> 13:39.075
Hey, Chris.

13:39.077 --> 13:41.110
I see you walked
across the grass again

13:41.112 --> 13:42.745
instead of
using the walk.

13:42.747 --> 13:44.447
You're really wearing
a path, aren't you?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.948
We call that
Chris's Trail.

13:45.950 --> 13:46.949
Right there.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.451
Chris's Trail.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.887
Mr. Quagmire,
I completed that sex rehab

13:50.889 --> 13:52.588
and I paid my debt to society,

13:52.590 --> 13:55.324
but people are still afraid of
me, like I'm some kind of creep.

13:55.326 --> 13:56.993
How do I get them to treat me

13:56.995 --> 13:58.795
the way they did
before all this happened?

13:58.797 --> 14:00.563
You can't. I'm sorry, Chris,

14:00.565 --> 14:02.632
but you're just gonna have
to accept that from now on,

14:02.634 --> 14:04.634
people are gonna see you
as a sex-crazed pervert.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.903
And there's nothing
you can do to change that.

14:06.905 --> 14:09.739
Wait a minute,
maybe there is.

14:09.741 --> 14:11.307
Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.341
No problem, Chris.

14:12.343 --> 14:13.576
You keep that
chin up, huh?

14:13.578 --> 14:14.577
I will.

14:14.579 --> 14:16.145
Hey, can I ring
your doorbell?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.413
No, I'd rather you...
(doorbell rings)

14:17.415 --> 14:18.414
(cat shrieks)

14:18.416 --> 14:19.782
That's why "no," Chris.

14:19.784 --> 14:21.083
That's why "no."

14:27.759 --> 14:30.193
Chris? What the hell
happened to you?

14:30.195 --> 14:31.661
(androgynous voice):
Mother, Father,

14:31.663 --> 14:34.463
I decided to have myself
chemically castrated.

14:34.465 --> 14:36.098
Why the hell would
you do that?!

14:36.100 --> 14:38.501
Now nobody will have
any reason to be afraid of me

14:38.503 --> 14:40.102
or think I'm a pervert,

14:40.104 --> 14:43.139
and everybody can just
treat me like normal again.

14:43.141 --> 14:46.542
Oh, my God, I can't believe
my son's some kind of weirdo!

14:46.544 --> 14:48.044
Oop, here comes
another sandwich.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.515
I can't even look at you.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.524
(androgynous voice):
Has anyone seen my sandals?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.359
Yeah, no, nobody's seen
your sandals.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.895
Well, I'll just have
to make another pair.

15:05.897 --> 15:08.865
Look, Chris, I know you
think chemical castration

15:08.867 --> 15:10.333
is gonna solve
your problems,

15:10.335 --> 15:12.869
but you have to stop
taking those pills.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.370
I don't have to do anything,

15:14.372 --> 15:16.405
besides get to the wind chime
store before it closes.

15:16.407 --> 15:18.341
There can't be
a whole store.

15:18.343 --> 15:20.810
To be fair, they also have
a couple of kaleidoscopes.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.078
Ah, can I come?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.213
Lois, can I go to the store
with that thing?

15:24.215 --> 15:27.817
Splendid. I'll go get
my burlap wallet.

15:27.819 --> 15:31.721
Wow, we rolled three gutter
balls on these kids, huh?

15:43.101 --> 15:45.568
My word, Brian,
you're really improving.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.936
We might actually
win this thing.

15:46.938 --> 15:48.571
Thanks. You know,
I just pretend

15:48.573 --> 15:50.273
that tennis ball
is Mitch McConnell

15:50.275 --> 15:52.508
trying to roll back subsidies
on the Affordable Care Act,

15:52.510 --> 15:53.943
and I'm like, "Nope!"

15:53.945 --> 15:55.945
Yeah, I-I don't... I don't
need to hear your process.

15:55.947 --> 15:57.380
Look, I'm just happy
you pushed me,

15:57.382 --> 15:58.781
'cause now I can't wait
for that tournament.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.616
I know,
it's gonna be great.

16:00.618 --> 16:03.586
And I already know exactly
where I'm gonna put that trophy.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.021
So the baby died?

16:05.023 --> 16:06.455
Yeah, the baby died.

16:06.457 --> 16:08.691
But, look, first place.

16:12.897 --> 16:15.898
Chris, your mother and I want
you to stop taking them pills.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.234
There's a lot of great things
about having a sex drive

16:18.236 --> 16:20.303
that you're missing out on.
Like what?

16:20.305 --> 16:23.039
Well, there's the post-orgy
meals at a swingers party.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.308
Come on, let's eat with
these wonderful people.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.710
Hey, everybody,
try my wife's ambrosia.

16:27.712 --> 16:30.713
If you liked my wife's snizz,
you're gonna love her ambrosia.

16:30.715 --> 16:32.748
I was thinking about
this seven-layer dip

16:32.750 --> 16:34.884
the whole time I
was chowing Ronald.

16:34.886 --> 16:36.319
I don't like this.

16:36.321 --> 16:37.753
I want to go home.

16:37.755 --> 16:38.955
You know what's sad?

16:38.957 --> 16:41.891
There's hardly any other
fathers and sons here.

16:45.897 --> 16:47.163
I don't know, Lois.

16:47.165 --> 16:49.332
I just don't think Chris
is gonna change his mind.

16:49.334 --> 16:50.733
(sighs)
I know.

16:50.735 --> 16:52.001
It's only a matter of time

16:52.003 --> 16:53.602
before he shaves
one side of his head

16:53.604 --> 16:55.571
and swoops the rest
of the hair over.

16:55.573 --> 16:57.907
Why, is that...
is that bad?

16:57.909 --> 17:00.009
Good early
evening, everyone.

17:00.011 --> 17:02.011
I have celebratory news.

17:02.013 --> 17:06.182
With all the free time, I'm
no longer devoting to onanism...

17:06.184 --> 17:07.984
That's spanking it?
Yes, Peter.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.820
...I have managed to redirect
that energy into my studies.

17:10.822 --> 17:14.256
In fact, today I received
the Kaplan Prize in biology.

17:14.258 --> 17:16.258
Chris, that's great!

17:16.260 --> 17:19.628
Not only that, I got the highest
score on my Spanish test,

17:19.630 --> 17:21.764
and I even joined
the debate team.

17:21.766 --> 17:23.666
That's amazing!

17:23.668 --> 17:26.669
All right, well, I'm gonna
put some flowers in a wagon

17:26.671 --> 17:28.571
and walk around town.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.607
You know what, Peter?

17:31.609 --> 17:33.976
Maybe there's a silver
lining to this fiasco.

17:33.978 --> 17:35.978
Not thinking about
sex all the time

17:35.980 --> 17:38.848
seems to have allowed Chris
to excel in other areas.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.216
He does seem sharper.

17:40.218 --> 17:42.118
Heck, the old Chris
couldn't even figure out

17:42.120 --> 17:44.120
the self-checkout
at the supermarket.

17:44.122 --> 17:46.489
REGISTER: (beeps) Please place
the item in the bagging area.

17:46.491 --> 17:48.891
Please remove the item
from the bagging area.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.894
Please take a plastic bag
from the bagging area.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.430
Please put the bag over
your head and tighten.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.867
(gasping)

18:00.738 --> 18:02.204
(laughing)
(laughing)

18:02.206 --> 18:04.173
I told you I could
make him do it.

18:04.175 --> 18:05.474
That's hard-core, man.

18:05.476 --> 18:07.476
You're hard-core.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.316
All right, Brian,
we win this set,

18:14.318 --> 18:15.518
the tournament's ours.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.852
Yeah, come on,
let's do this.

18:16.854 --> 18:18.988
I can already see our
names in the newsletter,

18:18.990 --> 18:21.424
right below the deaths
from the previous quarter.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.600
Out.
What?!

18:31.602 --> 18:32.768
Your ball was long.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.003
Are you (bleep) me?!

18:34.005 --> 18:35.204
That thing was in!

18:35.206 --> 18:36.605
You're gonna penalize us

18:36.607 --> 18:39.575
because you're a blind (bleep)
blue jacket (bleep)?!

18:39.577 --> 18:40.843
Stewie, calm down.

18:40.845 --> 18:42.411
I will drop you
to your knees

18:42.413 --> 18:44.447
and shove my racket so
far down your throat

18:44.449 --> 18:46.615
you'll be (bleep)
my grip for a week!

18:46.617 --> 18:48.017
Warning, Mr. Griffin.

18:48.019 --> 18:50.386
Oh, you're warning me?!
I'm warning you!

18:50.388 --> 18:53.089
I'm gonna go to your house
and (bleep) your wife!

18:53.091 --> 18:56.058
You proud of yourself,
tennis club security guard?

18:56.060 --> 18:57.893
Your kids look up to you?
Big man.

18:57.895 --> 19:00.296
Throwing out a baby and a dog.
Tough guy.

19:00.298 --> 19:02.731
Maybe I'll see you later when
you don't have that name tag on.

19:02.733 --> 19:04.133
I thought your
shot was in.

19:04.135 --> 19:05.968
Oh, hey, pound it, dude.

19:09.907 --> 19:11.941
So to find the area
of this circle,

19:11.943 --> 19:15.311
we're going to need to use pi,
whose digits go on forever.

19:15.313 --> 19:18.781
(chuckles) Can you imagine
if our pi was endless?

19:18.783 --> 19:21.150
We'd all be changing
our belt sizes.

19:21.152 --> 19:23.152
(chuckles)

19:23.154 --> 19:25.221
Thanks, Chris.

19:25.223 --> 19:26.789
Wow, that was
really something.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.290
Marcy?

19:28.292 --> 19:31.327
I had no idea you were
such an amazing tutor.

19:31.329 --> 19:32.661
And I really like
your pendant.

19:32.663 --> 19:36.165
Thanks, but why are you
being so nice to me?

19:36.167 --> 19:38.167
You got me in so much
trouble before.

19:38.169 --> 19:40.169
Yeah, I'm really
sorry about that.

19:40.171 --> 19:42.238
That was just my dumb,
overprotective dad.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.739
Really?

19:43.741 --> 19:46.442
Yeah, he took my phone to look
at pictures of my friends,

19:46.444 --> 19:48.010
and he found the
one you sent.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.578
I bet that caught him
by surprise.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.846
Definitely.

19:50.848 --> 19:54.316
Well, I hope you know
that's not who I am anymore.

19:54.318 --> 19:58.320
I do, and I hope I didn't
cause you too much trouble.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.460
(alarm blaring)

20:04.462 --> 20:05.861
This is not a drill!

20:05.863 --> 20:07.830
I repeat, not a drill!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.934
Good to be back doing
this again, huh, Bill?

20:11.936 --> 20:13.769
What, shoveling
coal into a penis?

20:13.771 --> 20:15.004
I was sleeping.

20:16.374 --> 20:17.640
What's happening?!

20:17.642 --> 20:19.041
(normal voice):
I don't know.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.177
Someone... someone get me
nude art books!

20:21.179 --> 20:23.279
I need nude art books!

20:23.281 --> 20:25.114
Oh, good, Chris.

20:25.116 --> 20:27.116
You can hang this
<i>New York Times</i> back on...

20:27.118 --> 20:29.952
(gasps):
Oh, a pee-pee!

20:33.691 --> 20:36.125
Well, Chris, you
killed that librarian,

20:36.127 --> 20:38.561
but we're glad to have you
back to your old self.

20:38.563 --> 20:41.197
Mrs. Lapardo worked at
that school for 54 years.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.798
Well, at least
she saw a little wang

20:42.800 --> 20:44.166
before taking that dirt nap.

20:44.168 --> 20:45.501
Thanks, you guys.

20:45.503 --> 20:48.637
I guess chemical castration
isn't for everyone.

20:48.639 --> 20:51.574
I-Is that... is that
the lesson for this week?

20:51.576 --> 20:54.577
Uh, I guess it's that or
be kinder on the tennis court.

20:54.579 --> 20:56.078
Where have you been?

21:32.049 --> 21:34.116
