08:47.060 --> 08:48.193
Cool, that's
great to hear.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.227
Hey, where's Patty?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.228
Oh, I don't know.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.630
Probably at her house?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.465
(laughs) You're
hilarious, Meg.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.867
Hey, so, uh, what kind of movies
do you and your friends like?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.302
Well, Ruth likes...
Not her.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.703
Esther likes...
Not her.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.005
I like...
Patty, just Patty.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.007
Oh, she loves anything

09:02.009 --> 09:04.409
where a teenage girl
is sick and dies of cancer.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.845
Or any movie where
a character is named Patty.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.980
Ugh, she loses
her mind for that.

09:08.982 --> 09:12.117
Well, okay, Miss Chatterbox,
you better get off to school.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.754
Wow, you're really
obsessed with Patty.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.256
You want her even more than
I wanted the new iPhone.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.891
How's it going?
Good.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.326
Just looking forward to
getting that new phone.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.327
What are you
talking about?

09:22.329 --> 09:23.728
This isn't
the Apple store.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.163
This is
a super-gay club.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.566
Yeah, right, I leave
and you get my phone.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.768
Nice try, cutie pie.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.836
♪ ♪

09:44.618 --> 09:47.619
Wow, there's so much
wildlife in Africa.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.621
You know, they say there's
some animal species here

09:49.623 --> 09:51.056
that haven't even
been discovered yet.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.457
Is that right?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.292
Yes, that is right.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.294
Oh, my God,
look over there!

09:58.732 --> 10:00.565
That African warlord
is brutalizing

10:00.567 --> 10:02.400
those innocent people.
Yeah, but it's okay,

10:02.402 --> 10:04.235
because he's wearing
a large cowboy hat

10:04.237 --> 10:06.071
and follows everything
with "hamburger,"

10:06.073 --> 10:08.073
like that stand-up
comic from the '90s.

10:08.075 --> 10:12.043
We are going to force all these
young boys to be child soldiers.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.878
Hamburger.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.080
(giggling)

10:15.082 --> 10:16.915
After 18 hours in the mines,

10:16.917 --> 10:18.917
we are going to check
your butts for diamonds.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.552
Hamburger.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.820
(laughs) I get it.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.887
If you do not work

10:22.889 --> 10:23.822
on my rubber plantation,

10:23.824 --> 10:25.790
I will burn your tongues.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.125
Oh, my God!

10:27.127 --> 10:28.560
Hamburger.

10:28.562 --> 10:29.961
(giggling)

10:29.963 --> 10:30.962
Ah, I found him.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.964
Alonzo "Hamburger" Jones.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.900
He made it to YouTube.
Must be filthy rich.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.740
Oh, my God!

10:41.742 --> 10:43.742
I didn't expect to
see you guys here.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.144
So teenagers know
about the mall, too?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.512
Know what
about the mall?

10:47.514 --> 10:48.513
Yeah, right?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.515
Boy, the day I'm having.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.350
I actually made
one too many Build-a-Bears

10:52.352 --> 10:53.785
for the cancer kids.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.954
If only I could build
a cure, huh?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.156
Aw...
Hey, you know
what, Patty?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.758
Why don't you take
the extra one?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.092
Wow, thanks, Brian.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.327
Yeah, that's cool, Brian.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.828
Will you buy me a hat at Lids?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.363
No. You know, Patty,

11:05.365 --> 11:07.599
I've got $7.50 left
on my Panda Express card,

11:07.601 --> 11:09.300
if you want to split
a three-item combo.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.669
No drink.
Sure!

11:10.671 --> 11:13.471
Well, then, hop on board
the Panda Express!

11:13.473 --> 11:15.540
(chuckles)
In bed, right?

11:15.542 --> 11:17.976
Like-like with the fortune
cookies, you know...

11:17.978 --> 11:20.278
Brian, can I talk
to you for a second?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.113
What the hell
is going on?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.815
You're hitting on Patty
and it's gross.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.050
She's 18!

11:25.052 --> 11:26.885
Stop it!
Me?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.687
Meg, I am not even
going to dignify that

11:28.689 --> 11:30.321
with a mall erection.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.524
Don't...
don't look down.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.559
(gentle African music playing)

11:38.131 --> 11:40.231
Well, we made it.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.167
East Bola.

11:42.169 --> 11:46.337
All right, let's find our
"prince" and get my money back.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.572
Get down!

11:47.574 --> 11:49.007
On the ground!
(yelps)

11:49.009 --> 11:50.241
This is unacceptable.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.143
I demand to speak
to Anthony Anderson.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.015
(phone ringing)

11:57.017 --> 11:58.850
Okay, hold on.
Shoot me if you must,

11:58.852 --> 12:01.119
but it is imperative
that I answer this call.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.589
Yello?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.424
Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.661
Yes, I did call you about the
eight-piece lawn croquet set.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.430
Now, it says "weathered,"
just how weathered is it?

12:12.432 --> 12:15.433
Yeah, go ahead and send me
a pic, that'd be very helpful.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.701
(phone chimes)

12:16.703 --> 12:18.336
Sir, shoot me if you must,

12:18.338 --> 12:20.972
but it is imperative
that I look at these pictures.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.215
The hell with this.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.282
I'm getting my money back

12:31.284 --> 12:32.751
if it's the last
thing I do.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.619
Hey, here's the guys.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.721
Who are you
and why are you here?

12:36.723 --> 12:38.189
I'm Carter Pewterschmidt,

12:38.191 --> 12:39.958
and I'm here because
you stole my money!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.293
You?
You are Carter Pewterschmidt?

12:42.295 --> 12:43.595
You're damn right I am!

12:43.597 --> 12:44.963
Oh! It's him!

12:44.965 --> 12:47.198
It's the Great Father
Pewterschmidt!

12:47.200 --> 12:49.567
What's happening?
What's he talking about?

12:49.569 --> 12:51.603
You are a great hero to us.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.371
It is with the money
that you sent

12:53.373 --> 12:54.973
that we have been able to make

12:54.975 --> 12:57.075
many wonderful improvements
to our village.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.244
And he used my computer.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.579
I'm Griff, by the way,
that's what everybody calls me.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.782
That's not true.
Nobody calls him that.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.087
It was your money that
paid for the school,

13:09.089 --> 13:11.723
a well to provide
clean drinking water,

13:11.725 --> 13:13.925
our first health clinic,

13:13.927 --> 13:16.494
and a Redbox with
one movie in it.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.962
It's<i> Baby Geniuses.</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:19.964
Which I, personally,
could begin watching

13:19.966 --> 13:22.000
at any point in the film
and enjoy from there.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.902
Oh, yeah, that's how
I feel about that video

13:23.904 --> 13:25.603
of Kelsey Grammer
fallin' off the stage.

13:25.605 --> 13:26.938
I don't understand.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.673
So there never was
a Nigerian prince?

13:28.675 --> 13:32.477
No. You see, no one will
actually give money to Africa

13:32.479 --> 13:34.078
unless they are tricked into it.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.814
So again, we thank you

13:35.816 --> 13:37.749
for your generosity,
Father Pewterschmidt.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.250
Well, I hope you enjoyed it...

13:39.252 --> 13:40.485
'cause I'm taking it all back.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.286
What?
What?

13:41.288 --> 13:42.687
You heard me!

13:42.689 --> 13:43.688
Nobody steals
from Carter Pewterschmidt

13:43.690 --> 13:44.956
and gets away with it!

13:44.958 --> 13:46.491
Carter, why you
bein' so mean?

13:46.493 --> 13:47.759
The money's spent.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.761
And look how happy
you made these people.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.830
Talk to me...
it's your buddy Griff.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.464
Tear it all down! Now.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.433
Or I'm canceling Kwanzaa.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.668
What is Kwanzaa?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.670
Ah!
I knew it wasn't real!

14:02.309 --> 14:03.708
Hey, there, babe.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.976
Hey, Brian.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.377
You ready?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.279
Got the Smash Mouth
cued up in the Pri.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.514
Brian, what are you doing here?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.449
I'm here to
pick up Patty.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.484
We're going to see a movie
called<i> Brittany Finds a Lump.</i>

14:13.486 --> 14:15.486
You're parked in
Mr. Tackleman's space.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.055
You're going on a date
with Patty?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.523
I told you to back off.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.525
And since when
do you wear high-tops?

14:20.527 --> 14:21.526
What, my kicks?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.794
Ah, it's nothin'.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.195
I just use these
for Instagram.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.463
That's something I like!

14:25.465 --> 14:26.698
Ah, shut up, Esther!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.466
All right, we're out of here.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.935

warmer, keep that box hot.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.253
Paying these thugs
to tear down the village

14:48.255 --> 14:49.520
isn't gonna bring
your money back.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.155
This isn't about the money.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.524
This is payback for Sammy
Davis dating Kim Novak.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.560
Oh, come on, Carter,
don't do this.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.528
You don't want to be

bad to Africa.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.064

15:36.202 --> 15:37.902

15:37.904 --> 15:40.939
Well, as a man
falsely imprisoned in Africa,

15:40.941 --> 15:43.708
I have no choice but to write
a memoir of my struggles.

"Chapter One:

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.591
Our top story:
sinking newscaster.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.494
Just kidding, it's the chair.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.630
But, in other news, domestic
abuse enthusiast Paul Simon

16:39.632 --> 16:42.200
has released a new song
inspired by a memoir

16:42.202 --> 16:44.535
written by Quahog's
own Peter Griffin,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.971
who has been falsely imprisoned
by his father-in-law

16:46.973 --> 16:48.439
in an African jail.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.541
Oh, for God's sake.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.578
I bet there's not one word
about you in that book.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.283
Wow, what a beautiful night.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.119
Yeah.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.788
Hey, I wonder if any of those
stars are wishing on us, huh?

17:03.790 --> 17:05.690
You're so deep.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.658
I betcha you're
pretty deep, too.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.528
Aw, you're so sweet.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.530
Why are you so nice to me?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.298
Most guys never give me
the time of day

17:14.300 --> 17:15.900
because I'm so plain-looking.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.568
Well, I'm not
like most guys.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.070
I can see past
that sweater.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.538
Speaking of which,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.240
why don't we get rid
of that big old thing?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.642
Brian, stop!

17:24.644 --> 17:26.344
