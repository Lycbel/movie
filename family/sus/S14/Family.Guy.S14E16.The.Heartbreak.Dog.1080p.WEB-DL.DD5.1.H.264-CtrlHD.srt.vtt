00:34.426 --> 00:36.293
(knocking)

00:36.295 --> 00:39.496
Hey, welcome to Bonnie's
29th birthday party.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.799
(laughing):
I ca... I can't keep this up.

00:42.801 --> 00:44.301
She's 46.

00:44.303 --> 00:46.103
Here, we brought you guys
an orchid from Trader Joe's,

00:46.105 --> 00:47.504
because we don't know

00:47.506 --> 00:49.906
or care about
any of your interests.

00:52.644 --> 00:54.211
Well, I put together
some videos

00:54.213 --> 00:55.846
for Bonnie's party.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.614
Here we are on our honeymoon.

00:57.616 --> 01:00.083
(mariachi music playing)

01:05.791 --> 01:07.691
Yeah, Cabo was great.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.027
We even went back
for our 10th anniversary.

01:10.029 --> 01:13.864
(mariachi music playing)

01:22.307 --> 01:25.208
Better wrap it up,
honey, tide's coming in.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.810
Well, let's break for presents,

01:26.812 --> 01:29.046
but after that, I'll show you
Susie's birth video,

01:29.048 --> 01:30.347
and I'll tell you,
she fell out of there

01:30.349 --> 01:32.649
like an orange out
of an old dress sock.

01:32.651 --> 01:36.019
Ugh, I have to text Rupert
what a train wreck this is.

01:36.021 --> 01:37.320
(quacking sound)

01:37.322 --> 01:39.890
Hey, I want real things.

01:43.595 --> 01:46.029
(toilet flushing)

01:46.031 --> 01:48.932
Kind of weird they're keeping
all our jackets in the tub.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.500
(crying)

01:52.571 --> 01:54.071
(crying continues)

01:54.073 --> 01:55.105
Bonnie?

01:55.107 --> 01:56.940
I told you, Joe,

01:56.942 --> 01:58.008
when we're alone,

01:58.010 --> 01:59.676
you can call me "Bonald."

01:59.678 --> 02:01.278
No, i-it's me, Brian.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.746
Is that your real name?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.048
I mean, are you...
are you okay?

02:05.050 --> 02:06.216
Sorry, am I
allowed on the bed?

02:06.218 --> 02:07.851
I guess so.

02:07.853 --> 02:08.919
What's wrong?

02:08.921 --> 02:10.087
Nothing.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.121
I have something
in my eye.

02:11.123 --> 02:12.456
Yes, you do.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.057
It looks
like sadness.

02:14.059 --> 02:15.625
Come on, you
can tell me.

02:15.627 --> 02:17.260
I'm your
neighbor's dog.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.228
I don't know.

02:18.230 --> 02:19.563
It's just that
when I was young,

02:19.565 --> 02:20.764
I had so many things

02:20.766 --> 02:22.732
I wanted to do
with my life,

02:22.734 --> 02:24.568
but now, I'm 46,

02:24.570 --> 02:28.105
and all I've ever done
is take care of Joe.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.539
And now you feel like
you never had a chance

02:29.541 --> 02:31.274
to be your true self.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.242
Yeah.

02:32.244 --> 02:33.710
I know just how you feel.

02:33.712 --> 02:35.145
I mean, I'm happy
that Peter found me

02:35.147 --> 02:36.880
and gave me a home, but

02:36.882 --> 02:38.081
sometimes I wonder

02:38.083 --> 02:39.583
if I'd be happier
on my own.

02:39.585 --> 02:40.984
Exactly.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.719
It's like sometimes,
I feel...

02:42.721 --> 02:43.954
Trapped?

02:43.956 --> 02:47.591
No, I was going to say,
"like the von Trapps."

02:47.593 --> 02:50.293
You know, unable to leave
their home in Austria.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.130
Oh. Well, that still
is remarkably close.

02:53.132 --> 02:56.900
Thanks for being
so nice to me, Brian.

02:56.902 --> 02:59.336
Why are you scratching
behind my ear?

02:59.338 --> 03:00.837
I... I don't...
I don't know.

03:00.839 --> 03:02.272
I thought it might
make you feel better.

03:02.274 --> 03:04.808
It does feel kind of nice.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.243
You're a good girl.

03:06.245 --> 03:07.844
You're going to be okay.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.285
(soft moaning)

03:15.287 --> 03:16.586
I'm... I'm sorry.

03:16.588 --> 03:17.821
I did... I didn't...
I didn't mean...

03:17.823 --> 03:19.156
No, it's okay.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.258
Um... I better go downstairs

03:21.260 --> 03:23.126
before Joe realizes
I'm gone.

03:23.128 --> 03:24.494
And before Peter

03:24.496 --> 03:26.663
gets into the stuff
that's not for the party.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.465
PETER:
Aw, Halloween candy!

03:28.467 --> 03:30.700
JOE:
Peter, get out
of the pantry.

03:30.702 --> 03:33.436
Ah, I can't believe I just
kissed my friend's wife.

03:33.438 --> 03:35.939
I'm a bigger scumbag than Spock.

03:35.941 --> 03:37.474
I heard that there
was a Romulan ship

03:37.476 --> 03:39.342
spotted in our sector,
which means...

03:39.344 --> 03:41.111
Hey, hey.

03:41.113 --> 03:43.547
(jabbering)

03:47.352 --> 03:49.352
Kids, this morning,
Principal Shepherd

03:49.354 --> 03:50.387
wanted to say a few words.

03:50.389 --> 03:51.821
Thank you, Mrs. Abbott.

03:51.823 --> 03:54.357
Uh, before I start,
are these the normal kids

03:54.359 --> 03:56.326
or kind of the
"dur, dur" ones?

03:56.328 --> 03:57.894
It's a healthy mix.

03:57.896 --> 03:58.962
Good morning, children.

03:58.964 --> 04:00.497
It's that time
of the year again

04:00.499 --> 04:02.966
to fulfill your
community service requirement

04:02.968 --> 04:04.201
by signing up
for volunteer work.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.802
Do we get to choose
our own jobs?

04:05.804 --> 04:07.137
No, no, no, no.

04:07.139 --> 04:08.905
The jobs will be
assigned randomly

04:08.907 --> 04:10.407
but the cooler
and prettier students

04:10.409 --> 04:11.641
have the better jobs.

04:11.643 --> 04:13.577
For instance, blonde
chick in the third row

04:13.579 --> 04:15.512
will wash<i> my</i> car
this afternoon

04:15.514 --> 04:17.747
while, Little Miss Frumpkin
with all the questions,

04:17.749 --> 04:19.649
will work in an
old folks' home.

04:19.651 --> 04:21.251
Is "frumpkin" good?

04:21.253 --> 04:23.286
(laughing):
No, no.

04:27.926 --> 04:29.326
Brian, what are you
doing up so late?

04:29.328 --> 04:31.228
Ah, I'm having
trouble sleeping.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.996
I got to tell you something.

04:32.998 --> 04:35.232
I kissed Bonnie last night.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.399
What?!

04:36.401 --> 04:37.534
I know! I know!
It was a huge mistake.

04:37.536 --> 04:39.336
So let's just do two
or three high-fives

04:39.338 --> 04:40.670
and then forget
it ever happened.

04:40.672 --> 04:42.439
Brian, if Joe finds out,
he'll kill you.

04:42.441 --> 04:43.540
Yeah, no kidding.

04:43.542 --> 04:44.574
That's why you can't
tell anybody.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.675
Promise me.

04:45.677 --> 04:46.843
Oh, don't worry.
Don't worry.

04:46.845 --> 04:48.411
I'm great at
keeping secrets.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.212
Well, except for
that one time

04:49.214 --> 04:51.281
you discovered
my hidden shame.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.618
Peter?

04:54.620 --> 04:55.752
Brian.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.554
I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

04:57.556 --> 04:59.889
I'm one of these guys now.

04:59.891 --> 05:03.260
I'm sorry, Brian, I'm sorry.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.932
Mrs. Parkhurst?

05:08.934 --> 05:10.700
I'm Meg, your new
student volunteer.

05:10.702 --> 05:14.904
Oh, you must be my
new student volunteer.

05:14.906 --> 05:16.373
Yeah, I just said that.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.208
What's your name, dear?

05:18.210 --> 05:19.476
It's Meg.

05:19.478 --> 05:21.411
Can... can I get
a new person?

05:21.413 --> 05:23.146
Nonsense, come in,

05:23.148 --> 05:24.447
and between you and me,

05:24.449 --> 05:27.217
I hate my new
student volunteer.

05:27.219 --> 05:28.652
That ugly little Meg.

05:28.654 --> 05:30.320
She says she's a girl,

05:30.322 --> 05:33.089
but she certainly has
a boy's body odor.

05:33.091 --> 05:35.058
(sighs)

05:38.597 --> 05:40.063
(doorbell ringing)

05:41.500 --> 05:42.932
Oh, come on in.

05:42.934 --> 05:45.335
Peter, Joe and Bonnie
are here for game night.

05:45.337 --> 05:46.336
Game night?

05:46.338 --> 05:48.438
Yeah, I figured it was
the least we could do,

05:48.440 --> 05:50.407
since you pulled up
a beheading video on your phone

05:50.409 --> 05:52.475
at their party
and showed it to everyone.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.611
It was really more about
how loud my phone can get.

05:54.613 --> 05:55.679
Peter, we're doing this.

05:55.681 --> 05:57.347
(sighs)
All right.

05:57.349 --> 05:58.748
But the Operation game
is out of batteries,

05:58.750 --> 06:00.483
so I'll have to
make the noise.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.451
(imitates buzzer)

06:01.453 --> 06:02.652
You hear that?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.355
That's the sound
of bad surgery.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.792
All right,
I'm awesome at charades.

06:08.794 --> 06:10.026
Guys are going first.

06:10.028 --> 06:11.695
Okay, go.

06:11.697 --> 06:13.463
Uh,<i> About a Boy.</i>

06:13.465 --> 06:15.298
Uh,<i> Four...</i>
<i>Four Weddings and a Funeral.</i>

06:15.300 --> 06:16.833
Uh,<i> Nine Months.</i>

06:16.835 --> 06:18.101
<i>Notting Hill.</i>

06:18.103 --> 06:19.602
Yes, it was<i> Notting Hill.</i>

06:19.604 --> 06:21.771
I'm going to go
get more wine.

06:23.141 --> 06:24.641
Oh, hey.

06:24.643 --> 06:26.142
Hi, Brian.

06:26.144 --> 06:28.478
Um, listen,
about the other night.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.447
You haven't told anyone,
have you?

06:30.449 --> 06:32.048
No, no, of course not.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.683
I was going to
ask if you had.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.618
Hey, Brian,
can you bring me up a snack?

06:35.620 --> 06:37.053
I'm supposed to be in bed.

06:37.055 --> 06:39.022
Look, the other
night was great,

06:39.024 --> 06:40.223
but it was a mistake.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.458
You're right.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.127
STEWIE:
Oh, man, what?

06:44.129 --> 06:45.395
Yeah, I me... I mean, there's...

06:45.397 --> 06:47.731
there's definitely some kind
of connection between us, but...

06:47.733 --> 06:49.499
I felt it, too,

06:49.501 --> 06:51.835
but maybe in another life, huh?

06:51.837 --> 06:53.737
(sighs)
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

06:53.739 --> 06:55.338
This could never work.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.540
Like porn movies
before sound.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.342
(lively piano music playing)

06:59.344 --> 07:03.980
(moaning and grunting)

07:03.982 --> 07:05.415
Ooh.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.550
Oh, there you are.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.752
Come on, Bonnie,
it's Joe's turn.

07:08.754 --> 07:11.221
Okay, here we go,
uh, uh, crippled guy...

07:11.223 --> 07:13.189
uh, cheating wife...

07:13.191 --> 07:15.925
uh, uh, cheating wife
of a crippled guy...

07:15.927 --> 07:19.028
Uh, dog... some... something
with a dog... uh, dog kiss.

07:19.030 --> 07:21.030
I-I-I, uh, I think
that's, uh, time.

07:21.032 --> 07:22.031
Your, your turn is over.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.366
Oh, sounds like, uh, sounds like

07:23.368 --> 07:25.335
dog kisses crippled guy's wife

07:25.337 --> 07:26.369
at your party.

07:26.371 --> 07:27.871
Wait, wait! I know it.

07:27.873 --> 07:29.606
The other night at your party,
Brian kissed Bonnie.

07:29.608 --> 07:30.740
(all gasp)
LOIS: What?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.942
Bonnie, is this true?

07:32.944 --> 07:34.577
Oh, my God.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.579
I know, making out with a dog?

07:36.581 --> 07:39.949
Can you even imagine a woman who
possibly does that for real?

07:51.596 --> 07:52.896
Uh, hi, Joe.

07:52.898 --> 07:54.264
Hi, Brian.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.766
Look, I-I want to apologize
for what happened.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.202
I-I-I didn't mean
to kiss Bonnie.

07:59.204 --> 08:01.070
Everybody had a little
too much to drink.

08:01.072 --> 08:02.539
It-it just happened.

08:02.541 --> 08:04.407
Uh, I hope we're still cool.

08:04.409 --> 08:05.708
Hey, don't worry about it.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.076
It was a crazy party.

08:07.078 --> 08:08.545
We ran out of salsa.

08:08.547 --> 08:09.946
(laughing)

08:09.948 --> 08:11.781
How do you run out of salsa?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.450
Anyway, we're good.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.751
(relieved sigh)
Really?

08:14.753 --> 08:15.985
Oh, thank God.

08:15.987 --> 08:18.388
I-I-I was worried you'd be mad.

08:18.390 --> 08:20.557
Mad? At my buddy, Brian?

08:20.559 --> 08:21.791
Not a chance.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.293
Hey, is that your car?

08:25.764 --> 08:26.996
What? No!

08:26.998 --> 08:27.997
Wh-what's he doing?

08:27.999 --> 08:29.499
My car was parked legally.

08:29.501 --> 08:32.168
Huh. Well, maybe your car

08:32.170 --> 08:34.737
violated some sort
of unspoken boundary.

08:34.739 --> 08:36.973
One that nobody
bothers to codify

08:36.975 --> 08:39.509
because it's just
common decency.

08:39.511 --> 08:41.144
Hey, Joe, is that the guy?

08:41.146 --> 08:42.178
Read your text, Jerry.

08:42.180 --> 08:43.813
Not supposed to say
you know me.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.682
Well, I hope your day
gets better, Brian,

08:45.684 --> 08:48.685
but, uh, I wouldn't
count on it.

08:48.687 --> 08:50.687
(evil laughter)

08:55.627 --> 08:58.328
Boy, it wasn't easy
Mrs. Parkhurst,

08:58.330 --> 08:59.863
but I think we
got the nail

08:59.865 --> 09:01.498
that was poking
through your slipper.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.666
Well, you strike
me as someone

09:03.668 --> 09:05.301
who's never going
to get married,

09:05.303 --> 09:06.536
that's for sure.

09:06.538 --> 09:08.638
Now get me my itch cream.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.472
Is it in the drawer?

09:09.474 --> 09:10.707
Shut up!

09:10.709 --> 09:12.809
I'm trying to
hum atonally.

09:12.811 --> 09:14.878
(hums atonally)

09:14.880 --> 09:16.212
Ugh.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.752
(humming continues)

09:25.891 --> 09:27.123
Here's your cream.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.358
See you Thursday.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.861
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I stole this.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.496
You know what?
I don't feel bad.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.164
That woman's a nightmare.

09:35.166 --> 09:38.034
(gasps)
Ooh, I should text this
to my best friend.

09:39.137 --> 09:40.136
(cell phone chimes)

09:40.138 --> 09:41.671
Sick brooch!

09:41.673 --> 09:44.574
Adam, are you done with
that mayor homework, yet?

09:44.576 --> 09:47.243
It's called a bill, Mom.

09:51.683 --> 09:52.849
Hey, Brian,

09:52.851 --> 09:55.251
I, uh, feel that things
have been awkward between us,

09:55.253 --> 09:57.186
but just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

09:57.188 --> 09:58.254
can I buy you a drink?

09:58.256 --> 09:59.956
You know what?
Sure, thanks.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.730
What the hell happened?

10:09.935 --> 10:11.601
Ah! How do I walk?!

10:11.603 --> 10:13.670
Are these forever?!

10:13.672 --> 10:17.740
I also rubbed my butt on you
while you were unconscious.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.344
I like to put stuff online.

10:26.551 --> 10:27.784
Meg, Mom said that...

10:27.786 --> 10:29.552
Hey, what's all this stuff?

10:29.554 --> 10:31.688
Stuff I stole from
the old folks' home.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.122
But you should see
how they treat me.

10:33.124 --> 10:35.124
Meg, that's no excuse.

10:35.126 --> 10:36.392
Stealing is just plain...

10:36.394 --> 10:38.761
Oh, my God, is that
someone else's glasses?

10:38.763 --> 10:41.097
I love wearing other
people's glasses.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.699
(laughs)

10:42.701 --> 10:44.767
Do I look like I stole
atomic secrets?

10:44.769 --> 10:45.902
You do.

10:45.904 --> 10:47.737
Wow, this is awesome.

10:47.739 --> 10:48.738
I want in.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.240
And<i> there's</i> the
splitting headache

10:51.242 --> 10:53.676
from wearing someone
else's glasses.

10:58.583 --> 11:01.985
Okay, Chris, here's a room
I haven't hit, yet.

11:01.987 --> 11:04.320
Here, follow my lead.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.423
Who's there?

11:07.425 --> 11:08.891
Why are you in my room?

11:08.893 --> 11:10.226
Oh, hi.

11:10.228 --> 11:13.296
You died, and I'm here
to take you to heaven.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.897
Um, upsy-daisy, here we go.

11:17.102 --> 11:18.668
Well, now that
I'm in heaven...

11:18.670 --> 11:20.903
(squeaky fart)

11:20.905 --> 11:22.071
Hurry, take everything,

11:22.073 --> 11:24.674
and be quick or we'll
be in bigger trouble

11:24.676 --> 11:26.809
than a fat guy
at a water park.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.245
Come on, Dad, let's go
on the water slide.

11:29.247 --> 11:30.947
(sighs)
I can't fit.

11:30.949 --> 11:33.082
I'm afraid
I'll get stuck.

11:33.084 --> 11:34.450
I'll just go in
the lazy river.

11:34.452 --> 11:35.585
But, Dad...

11:35.587 --> 11:38.588
No, son, this is
the life I've chosen.

11:39.591 --> 11:43.026
♪ When your day is long ♪

11:45.330 --> 11:47.697
♪ And the night ♪

11:47.699 --> 11:52.001
♪ The night is yours alone ♪

11:54.706 --> 11:56.673
♪ When you're sure you... ♪

11:56.675 --> 11:58.741
(music stops)

12:03.948 --> 12:07.784
(music resumes):
♪ ...you've had enough ♪

12:07.786 --> 12:12.021
♪ Of this life... ♪

12:14.959 --> 12:16.492
Guys, thanks again
for doing this.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.561
Joe has been making
my life hell.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.562
Of course.

12:19.564 --> 12:20.863
All right,
now when Joe gets here

12:20.865 --> 12:21.831
we're just going to tell him

12:21.833 --> 12:23.032
he needs to lighten up on Brian,

12:23.034 --> 12:24.567
and then we'll all talk
this thing out

12:24.569 --> 12:26.069
so we can move past it.

12:26.071 --> 12:27.837
And then I get
to show my card trick?

12:27.839 --> 12:29.138
If there's time.

12:29.674 --> 12:30.940
Let's make this quick.

12:31.976 --> 12:34.010
What's going on?
What's all this?

12:34.012 --> 12:35.578
Joe, we all know what happened

12:35.580 --> 12:37.380
and we're here for you.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.982
But we think that you're taking
this revenge on Brian

12:39.984 --> 12:41.384
just a little too far.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.518
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean,
come on.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.886
It's...it's like
enough is enough.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.755
The Triscuits are
the rosemary kind,

12:45.757 --> 12:47.857
not the regular kind.

12:47.859 --> 12:50.593
Me? I'm not the guy
who violated the sanctity

12:50.595 --> 12:52.228
of someone else's marriage.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.730
Well, you make a
good point, Joe,

12:53.732 --> 12:55.331
and you're right,
this<i> is</i> Brian.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.699
We all know
he don't care

12:56.701 --> 12:58.234
where he gets
his wick wet.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.069
Just ask
Quagmire's father.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.271
Okay, we might be getting
a little off track, here.

13:02.273 --> 13:03.506
Yeah, yeah, Brian's right.

13:03.508 --> 13:04.841
Joe, you're out of control.

13:04.843 --> 13:05.742
Even though Brian's
been trying

13:05.744 --> 13:07.076
to do my wife for years,

13:07.078 --> 13:08.945
and on some level,
I hate him for it.

13:08.947 --> 13:10.913
Oh, Brian's a complete dick,
we all know that,

13:10.915 --> 13:12.548
but I think we're
losing sight of the point

13:12.550 --> 13:14.717
that Bonnie's a weird slut
who's always letting you know

13:14.719 --> 13:15.718
she's open for business.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.920
What? When am I doing that?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.522
Oh, come on, when are
you not doing that?

13:19.524 --> 13:20.857
With that
boo-boo-baby voice,

13:20.859 --> 13:22.725
and that
still-breastfeeding rack.

13:22.727 --> 13:23.893
(grunts)
Give me some of that!

13:23.895 --> 13:25.294
I'm Bonnie's friend,

13:25.296 --> 13:26.863
but she could
sometimes get the mail

13:26.865 --> 13:28.631
in something other than a robe.

13:28.633 --> 13:29.799
Okay, so we're all
in agreement,

13:29.801 --> 13:31.734
Bonnie and Brian
are terrible people.

13:31.736 --> 13:33.236
Quagmire, I want you
to think of a card,

13:33.238 --> 13:34.971
but do not tell me what it is.

13:34.973 --> 13:36.139
Okay, enough.

13:36.141 --> 13:38.407
How dare any of you
criticize Bonnie?

13:38.409 --> 13:40.576
For years, she gave
up her own dreams

13:40.578 --> 13:41.744
to take care of Joe.

13:41.746 --> 13:43.312
And yeah, maybe
she kissed me.

13:43.314 --> 13:44.781
Maybe she needed to
because she feels

13:44.783 --> 13:45.815
so trapped in
her marriage.

13:45.817 --> 13:46.983
It's true.

13:46.985 --> 13:50.219
No one ever takes the time
to ask how I feel.

13:50.221 --> 13:51.988
Brian's the only one.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.222
They don't get us, Bonnie,

13:53.224 --> 13:54.757
and you deserve
better than this.

13:54.759 --> 13:56.159
We both do.

13:56.161 --> 13:57.260
You know what?

13:57.262 --> 13:59.128
Let's get out of here.

14:05.136 --> 14:08.171
Wow, we are zero for two
on interventions today.

14:10.341 --> 14:11.974
I'm not changing for nobody.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.577
You're no... you're the ones
with the problems.

14:21.953 --> 14:23.486
Ah, we did it.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.354
We don't need those
narrow-minded losers.

14:25.356 --> 14:27.089
This is so exciting.

14:27.091 --> 14:29.926
We can finally live the
lives we've always wanted.

14:29.928 --> 14:32.361
Like, I can finally start
my jewelry design business

14:32.363 --> 14:35.398
making earrings for tweens.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.334
Listen, hear that?

14:38.336 --> 14:40.369
That is the sound
of not making

14:40.371 --> 14:41.938
an enormous mistake.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.806
I think I hear it.

14:43.808 --> 14:44.874
(alarm dinging)

14:44.876 --> 14:47.543
Oh, hang on, looks
like we need gas.

14:47.545 --> 14:49.812
So do you have,
like, a credit card?

14:49.814 --> 14:51.881
Nope and no cash, either,

14:51.883 --> 14:53.950
but I don't care.

14:53.952 --> 14:55.985
I couldn't stand
another moment with Joe.

14:55.987 --> 14:59.689
It was torture just watching
him do a crossword puzzle.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.024
Hey, Bonnie, what's a
five-letter word for marriage?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.392
Fraud.

15:03.394 --> 15:04.994
Uh, it's got to start
with a "U".

15:04.996 --> 15:06.362
Union.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.197
Boy, you stink at this.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.200
(big bang music plays)

15:11.202 --> 15:13.369
(music continues)

15:13.371 --> 15:16.172
Boy, it's just so
comforting to be here

15:16.174 --> 15:19.008
surrounded by
other people's memories.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.043
(blowing nose loudly)

15:21.045 --> 15:23.079
Back into the
sleeve with you.

15:23.081 --> 15:24.213
Can you hand me
another nylon

15:24.215 --> 15:26.816
that I use as a sock
with my huge beige shoe?

15:26.818 --> 15:29.051
Sure, and can you
hand me that ashtray?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.820
I might fire up
this pipe again.

15:30.822 --> 15:32.822
Chris, that's not
an ashtray.

15:32.824 --> 15:34.857
That's an urn
for someone's ashes.

15:34.859 --> 15:36.025
Really?

15:36.027 --> 15:37.260
Yeah, you've been
putting your pipe out

15:37.262 --> 15:38.527
in some guy.

15:38.529 --> 15:41.664
Oh, my God,
what are we doing?

15:41.666 --> 15:43.099
I feel awful.

15:43.101 --> 15:45.201
We need to give
everything back.

15:45.203 --> 15:47.103
Oh, you're right.

15:47.105 --> 15:49.038
We need to do
the right thing.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.207
Like the dad
from<i> Small Wonder.</i>

15:51.209 --> 15:52.341
All right, Vickie,

15:52.343 --> 15:54.076
time to shut you down
for the night.

15:54.078 --> 15:54.877
(robotic voice)
Good-night.

15:54.879 --> 15:58.414
See you tomorrow.

16:02.053 --> 16:03.419
(hisses through teeth)

16:03.421 --> 16:05.655
Nah.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.961
(sighs)
She's really gone,

16:11.963 --> 16:13.930
and she took little
Susie with her.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.932
I miss that baby
more than anything.

16:15.934 --> 16:19.068
(Susie crying)

16:19.070 --> 16:20.603
Oh, I guess she
left it here.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.871
Joe, I want you to know,

16:21.873 --> 16:24.040
I will not support
that relationship.

16:24.042 --> 16:25.541
If Brian and Bonnie
get married,

16:25.543 --> 16:26.742
I will not go.

16:26.744 --> 16:28.945
Although, Brian might want
me to be his best man.

16:28.947 --> 16:29.979
Then I'd have to go,

16:29.981 --> 16:32.081
and I'd have to dance.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.983
It would be weird to
be best man and not dance.

16:33.985 --> 16:35.151
And I'd have
to give a toast,

16:35.153 --> 16:36.819
and say that Bonnie's
the best thing

16:36.821 --> 16:37.887
that ever happened to him.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.088
You know, she is
the best thing

16:39.090 --> 16:40.890
that ever happened to him,
but don't worry, Joe.

16:40.892 --> 16:42.258
I'll only refer to you
as Bonnie's ex.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.427
You know, like,
"Bonnie has an ex,

16:44.429 --> 16:46.329
but Brian marks the spot."

16:46.331 --> 16:47.396
Oh, Peter, that's good.

16:47.398 --> 16:48.631
Thanks, babe.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.599
I hope Brian and Bonnie
are as happy as us.

16:50.601 --> 16:52.301
To Brian and Bonnie.

16:57.442 --> 16:59.408
Bad news:
the teenage runaways

16:59.410 --> 17:01.777
at table four were
not big tippers.

17:01.779 --> 17:04.280
We just need enough
money to get to Taos.

17:04.282 --> 17:05.648
That's like the capital

17:05.650 --> 17:07.683
of making and selling
your own jewelry.

17:07.685 --> 17:09.018
Okay, enough about
the jewelry.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.019
Do you even know
how to make it?

17:10.021 --> 17:11.854
I know how to
make jewelry.

17:11.856 --> 17:12.989
I just don't know

17:12.991 --> 17:16.125
how to make the
metal go into shapes.

17:16.127 --> 17:16.959
Hey, you know what'd be great?

17:16.961 --> 17:18.127
If you could talk with even

17:18.129 --> 17:20.162
a little bit of inflection
to your voice,

17:20.164 --> 17:22.765
so it doesn't sound so much
like a (bleep) power sander.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.100
Screw you.

17:24.102 --> 17:26.002
You tweet things that
aren't worth tweeting.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.103
Well, I'm sorry,

17:27.105 --> 17:28.471
but Kim Kardashian
did get famous

17:28.473 --> 17:29.939
for making a sex tape.

17:29.941 --> 17:31.173
We all know that.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.325
That's not yours.

17:32.326 --> 17:33.476
And stop breathing
through your mouth.

17:33.478 --> 17:35.111
It's really annoying.

17:35.113 --> 17:36.112
I'm panting.

17:36.114 --> 17:37.313
That's how I sweat,
you dumb bitch.

17:37.315 --> 17:38.481
No, it isn't.

17:38.483 --> 17:40.182
Dogs sweat
through their paws.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.484
You're such a
know-it-all, Brian,

17:41.486 --> 17:43.953
you don't even know
about your own body.

17:43.955 --> 17:45.588
At least I've
had an orgasm.

17:46.391 --> 17:49.158
Wow, I am sorry.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.193
Look, th-this isn't us.

17:51.195 --> 17:51.994
This is just the no food

17:51.996 --> 17:53.396
and sleeping in
a car talking.

17:53.398 --> 17:55.031
We can make this work,

17:55.033 --> 17:57.033
like couples who
meet on Craigslist.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.070
BOTH:
You're not what you look like
in your picture.

18:01.072 --> 18:03.572
Let's get this over with.

18:03.574 --> 18:06.275
I wonder which one of us
is the murderer?

18:11.816 --> 18:13.849
Okay, we ditch this stuff
in the day room,

18:13.851 --> 18:15.484
and then I'm done
with my volunteer hours

18:15.486 --> 18:17.319
and we never come
back here again.

18:19.690 --> 18:20.923
Mrs. Parkhurst?

18:20.925 --> 18:24.860
Look at you two,
stealing from the elderly.

18:24.862 --> 18:26.929
You're worse than that
Juliette Lewis

18:26.931 --> 18:28.664
who makes out with dogs.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.099
Wait, is that a real thing?

18:30.101 --> 18:31.167
Where did you hear that?

18:31.169 --> 18:32.669
What are your sources?

18:32.670 --> 18:34.170
Listen, we're very sorry
we stole from you,

18:34.172 --> 18:35.104
but you have it all back now,

18:35.106 --> 18:37.073
so we cool, right?

18:37.075 --> 18:40.109
You know I should call
the police on you.

18:40.111 --> 18:41.210
The police?!

18:41.212 --> 18:44.547
Or maybe, instead,
we do things my way.

18:44.549 --> 18:46.248
What's that?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.084
You will spend time with us

18:48.086 --> 18:50.119
every afternoon after school,

18:50.121 --> 18:52.621
doing jigsaw puzzles,

18:52.623 --> 18:54.723
reading us the newspaper,

18:54.725 --> 18:59.061
listening to poorly remembered
stories that have no point.

18:59.063 --> 19:01.197
You monster.

19:01.199 --> 19:02.198
Sit down.

19:03.568 --> 19:05.434
Now I feel some
dementia coming.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.269
Feed me pudding
while I grip

19:07.271 --> 19:09.572
your wrist in terror.

19:09.574 --> 19:12.108
Ah, this isn't
my house.

19:15.646 --> 19:17.146
See, if I make
under 20 grand

19:17.148 --> 19:18.247
for 20 years,

19:18.249 --> 19:19.882
my film school debt
just goes away.

19:19.884 --> 19:21.250
That's a government rule.

19:21.252 --> 19:22.818
(bell jingles)
Bonnie?

19:22.820 --> 19:23.953
Joe?

19:23.955 --> 19:25.588
How did you find me?

19:25.590 --> 19:28.057
Love is a powerful compass.

19:28.059 --> 19:31.060
Any time I quiet my mind
and clear my heart,

19:31.062 --> 19:32.895
it always leads me to you.

19:32.897 --> 19:34.830
Plus, dirtbag here has
a chip in his ear.

19:34.832 --> 19:36.132
I do?
Damn it.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.167
No wonder Peter's so good
at hide-and-seek.

19:38.169 --> 19:40.136
You're under the canoe
in Quagmire's yard.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.770
BRIAN:
Son of a bitch!

19:41.772 --> 19:44.306
Bonnie, I understand
now why you left.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.276
Over the years, I probably have
become too dependent on you,

19:47.278 --> 19:50.346
and I'm sorry if you've
had to put your dreams

19:50.348 --> 19:52.248
on hold because of me.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.016
Oh, Joe.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.784
But I'm here to
fight for you, Bonnie.

19:55.786 --> 19:57.786
And if you're willing
to come back home,

19:57.788 --> 20:01.023
I promise I'll spend the rest
of my days taking care of you,

20:01.025 --> 20:03.826
just the way you've
always taken care of me.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.095
Of course,
I want to come home, Joe.

20:06.097 --> 20:07.530
I love you.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.800
(moaning)

20:11.802 --> 20:14.937
Wow, I guess just
call me Cupid, huh?

20:14.939 --> 20:16.939
You're welcome.

20:16.941 --> 20:18.307
Ow! Damn it!

20:18.309 --> 20:20.176
(groaning)

20:20.178 --> 20:22.144
Hey, Bri, came to try
that apple pie

20:22.146 --> 20:23.279
you were texting about.

20:23.281 --> 20:24.513
Oh, you're shot.

20:28.386 --> 20:30.186
Well, Chris and I sure
learned a lot this week.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.154
Ha, you think<i> you</i>
learned a lot.

20:32.156 --> 20:33.322
I had quite
an adventure.

20:33.324 --> 20:34.323
You know what guys?

20:34.325 --> 20:36.125
We only got like
15 seconds left.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.226
We're going to have
to do these at the same time.

20:37.228 --> 20:38.460
Let's race.

20:38.462 --> 20:39.962
And... go.

20:39.964 --> 20:41.197
So Chris and I learned
that just 'cause people are old,

20:41.199 --> 20:42.798
that doesn't mean
you should steal from them.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.366
Bonnie didn't let you
stir the paint, did she?

20:44.368 --> 20:46.368
No. But I am done messing
around with neighbors' wives.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.870
Here's an invitation
to Donna's birthday party.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.338
'Cause maybe then
I'd like it.
Hey, let me see that.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.240
You rascal.
Same old Meg.

20:51.242 --> 20:53.142
And the winner is:
Nobody.

20:53.144 --> 20:55.411
Especially not you.
Good night.
