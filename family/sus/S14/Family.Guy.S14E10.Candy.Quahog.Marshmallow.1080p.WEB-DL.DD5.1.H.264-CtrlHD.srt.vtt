What I'm trying
to say is...

20:00.033 --> 20:02.533
guys, I'm coming back
to Quahog with you.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.668
You are?

20:03.670 --> 20:04.969
Oh, that's great!

20:04.971 --> 20:06.404
But wait, won't
that upset Sujin

20:06.406 --> 20:08.072
and your new
Korean family?

20:08.074 --> 20:09.307
What, are you kidding?

20:09.309 --> 20:10.508
They all got to be
in a K-pop song.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.742
That's all anyone here wants.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.644
Look, Great-Grandma is so happy,

20:13.646 --> 20:15.713
she finally died
and became a ghost.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.821
♪ ♪

20:23.823 --> 20:26.157
Thanks again for convincing me
to come home, guys.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.825
No problem, Quagmire.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.528
Looks like Donna's mother's
funeral went well.

20:30.530 --> 20:34.432
Odd choice to have an open
casket for a gunshot suicide.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.933
Yep, I thought
I wanted a family,

20:35.935 --> 20:38.169
but I love having
no responsibilities here.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.238
I can get drunk whenever,
sleep with anyone,

20:40.240 --> 20:41.872
and just hide in my house

20:41.874 --> 20:43.741
and avoid the world
if I feel like it.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.910
Wow, that's great,
and totally doesn't sound

20:45.912 --> 20:48.346
like symptoms
of clinical depression.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.548
I heard you gentleman
went to South Korea.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.549
Yeah.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.917
Well, that's cool.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.418
We went to Lake
Havasu, you losers!

20:54.420 --> 20:57.688
We nabbed so much
college beav!

21:32.959 --> 21:34.992
