Aw, man, I've been dying
to see<i> Maniac Pope 2.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:37.527
The first one
was awesome.

00:37.529 --> 00:39.196
Is this one of
those theaters

00:39.198 --> 00:41.198
where they bring your beef stew
right to your seat?

00:41.200 --> 00:42.366
What? That's
not a thing.

00:42.368 --> 00:43.967
Sure is.

00:43.969 --> 00:46.870
Don't get mad at me 'cause
you don't know nothing fancy.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.116
I feel like I'm
being watched.

00:59.118 --> 01:00.684
Of course
you are, silly.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.919
The Lord is always
watching us.

01:04.056 --> 01:06.256
(suspenseful music playing)

01:14.366 --> 01:17.234
May the sword
be with you.

01:18.070 --> 01:19.036
(gasps)

01:19.038 --> 01:21.571
And also with you!

01:21.573 --> 01:23.573
Geez, this movie sucks.

01:23.575 --> 01:25.008
I know,
it's terrible.

01:25.010 --> 01:26.576
(whispering): Excuse me,
who had the stroganoff

01:26.578 --> 01:27.844
with the roasted
potatoes?

01:27.846 --> 01:29.479
CLEVELAND:
Right here.

01:32.084 --> 01:34.751
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Excellency.

01:34.753 --> 01:36.186
Of course.

01:36.188 --> 01:37.921
What did you say your
name was, my child?

01:37.923 --> 01:40.624
Lucy.

01:41.427 --> 01:43.960
You've been "Lucified."

01:48.534 --> 01:49.900
That was awful.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.868
I know. They just redid
all the same stuff

01:51.870 --> 01:53.570
from the first<i> Maniac Pope.</i>

01:53.572 --> 01:54.938
Yeah, like in the first
<i>Maniac Pope,</i>

01:54.940 --> 01:57.574
he says to Bruce,
"You've been Brucified."

01:57.576 --> 01:58.575
Like, that's smart,
right?

01:58.577 --> 01:59.943
That's a smart line.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.912
But he did the same thing
twice in this movie.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.548
Once to Lucy and once earlier
when he found that wild goose.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.283
It's just
bad writing.

02:06.285 --> 02:07.884
Yeah, I mean, we could write
a better horror movie than that.

02:07.886 --> 02:09.719
Really? You
think we could?

02:09.721 --> 02:13.590
Absolutely. I'm as creative as
the first spider to spin a web.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.292
Hey, you know how
we always dreamed

02:15.294 --> 02:17.260
about having a house
that comes out of our butts?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.295
Uh, what?

02:18.297 --> 02:19.296
Eh?

02:19.298 --> 02:21.631
Yeah. Butt-house.

02:26.238 --> 02:28.238
I found your cigarettes.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.940
That's all I'm gonna say.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.208
Morning, everybody.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.276
And the crisis
continues.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.277
(chuckling):
What, these?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.378
Come on.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.280
Last thing I want
is attention.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.282
It's just that when you've
read as many books as I have,

02:39.284 --> 02:40.884
it-it takes a toll,
you know?

02:40.886 --> 02:42.285
You sure it's not
from watching

02:42.287 --> 02:44.287
too much close-up
porn on your phone?

02:44.289 --> 02:45.956
(chuckling): You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

02:45.958 --> 02:47.257
if they have that now.

02:47.259 --> 02:49.292
Brian, what do you
want for breakfast?

02:49.294 --> 02:50.794
Uh, hold on.

02:53.599 --> 02:56.266
What do I want?

02:56.268 --> 02:58.635
You're so full of it.
You don't need those things.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.237
Wait, who said that?

03:00.239 --> 03:01.605
Oh, Stewie.

03:01.607 --> 03:02.906
You are just horrible.

03:02.908 --> 03:04.241
You're even worse
than those people

03:04.243 --> 03:06.009
who take dumps
in the shower.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.145
What?

03:08.147 --> 03:09.446
W-Why are you cutting to me?

03:09.448 --> 03:10.780
What did somebody say?

03:10.782 --> 03:13.483
Whatever they said I do,
I don't do.

03:16.922 --> 03:19.256
All right, I got a
horror movie idea.

03:19.258 --> 03:20.924
It's called
<i>Cereal Killer.</i>

03:20.926 --> 03:24.194
A serial killer who only
kills people who eat cereal.

03:24.196 --> 03:26.930
Wait, what... what if God
is a serial killer?

03:26.932 --> 03:30.534
He lowers the average lifespan
of humans to 65,

03:30.536 --> 03:34.037
but there are many exceptions
based on genetics and diet.

03:34.039 --> 03:37.440
That's stupid-- I ain't never
heard of somebody lived to 65.

03:37.442 --> 03:39.509
Look, I think the problem is
this is a bar.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.844
We can't get inspired here.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.312
We have to go someplace
scary, you know?

03:42.314 --> 03:43.680
To put us in the mood.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.149
I got it: the old Quahog Asylum.

03:46.151 --> 03:47.851
What?! We can't go there.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.853
That place has been
abandoned for years.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.222
And they say it's haunted
by a ghost with a hook-hand.

03:52.224 --> 03:53.857
That's why it's
the perfect place.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.292
If we want to write
a scary movie,

03:55.294 --> 03:56.560
we need to do it
somewhere scary.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.228
Well, I guess
we could try it.

03:58.230 --> 04:00.830
We have sort of just been
spinning our wheels here.

04:00.832 --> 04:02.132
No offense, Joe.

04:02.134 --> 04:04.134
(sighs) I guess
Cleveland's right.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.136
So far, this has been
a bigger waste of time

04:06.138 --> 04:08.405
than an acceptance speech
at the Asperger's Awards.

04:08.407 --> 04:10.407
I'd like to thank
everyone I've ever met,

04:10.409 --> 04:12.742
in the order that I met them,
last name first,

04:12.744 --> 04:16.046
and if anyone interrupts me,
I'll have to start over.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.058

04:31.196 --> 04:33.430
♪ ♪

04:46.445 --> 04:48.578
(thunder crashes)

04:48.580 --> 04:50.013
This place
is terrible.

04:50.015 --> 04:51.414
Are you kidding?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.949
It's the perfect place
to write a horror movie.

04:52.951 --> 04:54.117
All right, well, I got an idea.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.719
You know, I like
them horror movies

04:55.721 --> 04:57.520
where you got a couple
of teenagers getting busy

04:57.522 --> 04:59.422
in their car at Makeout Point,

04:59.424 --> 05:01.691
but there's a killer
on the loose.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.600
Hey, Stacy, what do you say
we go all the way tonight?

05:10.602 --> 05:13.036
And then I unload
on the sun visors.

05:13.038 --> 05:14.638
Is that all
you ever think about?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.640
And besides, Richie,
aren't you worried

05:16.642 --> 05:19.042
about what the man on the radio
is saying right now?

05:19.044 --> 05:22.212
TOM TUCKER:
Another dead teenage couple
was found at Makeout Point,

05:22.214 --> 05:24.147
clawed beyond recognition.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.415
You see?

05:25.417 --> 05:26.883
There's a dangerous
creature out there.

05:26.885 --> 05:29.552
Oh, what, you mean the
big, rabid, slobbery cat

05:29.554 --> 05:31.154
what's been scratching
people to death?

05:31.156 --> 05:32.889
I don't believe
it exists, Stacy.

05:32.891 --> 05:35.292
Now, help me get the right
angle and lower the visor.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.260
(cat yowls in distance)

05:37.262 --> 05:38.595
Richie,
did you hear that?

05:38.597 --> 05:39.896
Will you calm down?

05:39.898 --> 05:41.298
We're the only
ones out here...

05:41.300 --> 05:42.499

05:56.815 --> 05:58.782
Wait, you were the guy
<i>and</i> the cat?

05:58.784 --> 06:00.450
And what's with
that visor stuff?

06:00.452 --> 06:02.252
Did Richie achieve
release?

06:02.254 --> 06:03.520
Okay, of the three of you,

06:03.522 --> 06:05.021
Cleveland's the only one
who gets it.

06:05.023 --> 06:06.956
That's an awful idea.
Well, I got one.

06:06.958 --> 06:09.192
We should write one of them
zombie movies

06:09.194 --> 06:11.828
where a guy wakes up in a
comfortable cotton hospital gown

06:11.830 --> 06:14.964
with the back open so there's
a nice breeze on your behind,

06:14.966 --> 06:16.833
and he's like, "This ain't bad."

06:16.835 --> 06:20.170
But then he notices
the hospital's empty!

06:24.943 --> 06:28.345
Nurse, I'm ready
for my sponge bath.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.779
Hmm.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.348
What happened to this place?

06:31.350 --> 06:33.216
Everybody up and gone.

06:35.987 --> 06:38.288
(electrical crackling)

06:38.290 --> 06:40.323
Hmm, that's annoying.

06:40.325 --> 06:42.525
(static hissing)

06:43.895 --> 06:46.229
Maybe it's a loose filament.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.297
(rattling)

06:47.299 --> 06:49.532
Nope, that's a busted bulb.

06:52.971 --> 06:54.637
These are all 145s.

06:54.639 --> 06:56.206
I need a 180.

06:58.577 --> 07:01.578
Well, now, maybe I did
need a 145.

07:03.415 --> 07:05.548
There we go.

07:06.985 --> 07:08.318
(pops)

07:08.320 --> 07:10.887
Damn it, I guess
it's a wiring issue.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.255
That's it?

07:12.257 --> 07:14.057
What the hell? When do
the zombies show up?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.425
That's the thing.

07:15.427 --> 07:17.527
Their shuttle was<i> late.</i>

07:17.529 --> 07:19.162
I-I don't know,
I-I was thinking

07:19.164 --> 07:20.563
we'd write a movie
where something

07:20.565 --> 07:22.866
that's not supposed
to be scary becomes scary.

07:22.868 --> 07:24.167
Like an evil doll.

07:24.169 --> 07:26.403
Yeah, or-or like an
evil bar of soap.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.905
Peter, I don't think
that's such a good id...
Too late!

07:32.210 --> 07:34.511
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

07:34.513 --> 07:38.181
Time to wash my body
with this harmless bar of soap.

07:38.183 --> 07:40.417
(dramatic music plays)

07:42.921 --> 07:44.854
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa,

07:44.856 --> 07:46.923
are you enjoying
that new soap I bought you

07:46.925 --> 07:48.558
from that mysterious Chinese man

07:48.560 --> 07:51.127
whose store was weirdly
not there the next day?

07:52.397 --> 07:54.264
Ambassador Mumbasa?

07:55.133 --> 07:57.567
Oh, my God, Ambassador Mumbasa!

07:57.569 --> 08:00.303
(dramatic music plays)

08:03.241 --> 08:04.941

08:08.880 --> 08:10.580
Ambassador Mumbasa?

08:10.582 --> 08:12.449
Assistant Ambassador Armstrong?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.384
Everything okay up there
with the bath?

08:17.222 --> 08:18.788
(screams)

08:29.434 --> 08:31.000
(gasps)

08:31.002 --> 08:34.771
I wonder if everything's okay
up at the old embassy.

08:34.773 --> 08:37.073
(wind howling, door slams)

08:37.075 --> 08:39.409
All right, maybe coming here
wasn't such a great idea.

08:39.411 --> 08:41.077
Is anybody else getting
a little freaked out

08:41.079 --> 08:42.645
by all these
scary stories?

08:42.647 --> 08:45.181
Yeah, even my
spine is tingling.

08:45.183 --> 08:46.449
You guys, I'm scared.

08:46.451 --> 08:47.650
You remember that movie
<i>The Blob?</i>

08:47.652 --> 08:48.852
What if the Blob?

08:48.854 --> 08:50.320
Let's get out of here!

08:52.357 --> 08:53.790
Aw, damn it, it's locked!

08:53.792 --> 08:55.658
Oh, my God, somebody
must have locked us in.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.360
We're gonna
die in here!

08:57.362 --> 08:59.262
(high-pitched scream)

09:00.465 --> 09:02.699
Sorry, guys,
somebody e-mailed me a video

09:02.701 --> 09:04.300
of a sheep screaming.

09:04.302 --> 09:06.503
(high-pitched scream)

09:13.678 --> 09:16.179
It was him.
It was the hook-handed killer.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.780
He locked us in!

09:17.782 --> 09:19.816
All the windows
have bars on 'em.

09:19.818 --> 09:22.452
I think the only way out of here
is through this duct system.

09:22.454 --> 09:25.388
Guys, do the words
"dead by dawn" scrawled

09:25.390 --> 09:27.790
in feces over there
mean we're in trouble?

09:27.792 --> 09:29.192
Did you do it?
I did.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.527
Then no.

09:35.066 --> 09:37.534
Still sticking with
the glasses, huh?

09:37.536 --> 09:38.535
What? Oh, right.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.169
Right, I have glasses.

09:40.171 --> 09:42.171
They're such a part of me now,
I-I forgot all about 'em.

09:42.173 --> 09:43.506
You're gross.

09:43.508 --> 09:44.908
You know, it's funny,

09:44.910 --> 09:46.509
I-I've gotten an awful
lot of writing done

09:46.511 --> 09:48.478
at that very table.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
You're a writer?
(Stewie groans)

09:50.482 --> 09:52.482
I-I like to consider
myself an observer.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.517
(chuckles) You have nice
breasts, for instance.

09:54.519 --> 09:56.519
(chuckles)
You want to join me?

09:56.521 --> 09:58.254
Guy with glasses
can't be all bad.

09:58.256 --> 09:59.489
Thanks.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.257
Boy, it's loud
in here, huh?

10:01.259 --> 10:04.327
Wh-When they said "Professor
Griffin," I barely heard them.

10:04.329 --> 10:06.262
That's it, I'm putting
an end to this.

10:06.264 --> 10:09.098
I'm gonna destroy those glasses
if it's the last thing I do.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.733
You should
really check out

10:10.735 --> 10:13.736
the Thanksgiving jazz
CD they sell here.

10:19.044 --> 10:20.743
(screaming)

10:24.349 --> 10:26.049
Where the hell are we?

10:26.051 --> 10:27.684
(footsteps echo)

10:27.686 --> 10:28.851
I heard something.

10:28.853 --> 10:30.520
Is... is someone else here?

10:30.522 --> 10:32.221
Oh, my God,
it's Hook-hand!

10:32.223 --> 10:33.590
He's coming for us!

10:33.592 --> 10:35.625
Damn it, why can't
I get any reception?

10:35.627 --> 10:37.961
Because we're in a basement
in the middle of nowhere.

10:37.963 --> 10:39.696
Besides,
if cell phones worked,

10:39.698 --> 10:41.364
every movie would be
two minutes long.

10:41.366 --> 10:43.199
Like<i> An Affair</i>
<i>to Remember.</i>

10:49.441 --> 10:52.141
Darling, I was running
to the Empire State Building

10:52.143 --> 10:54.477
to see you,
but I got hit by a car.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.713
No wonder you were late.
I'll be right down.

10:56.715 --> 10:57.747
Are you okay?

10:57.749 --> 10:59.816
I think I may be paralyzed.

10:59.818 --> 11:02.619
I'm sorry, there's nobody here
by that name.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.330
Wow, Stewie, thanks for
taking me to the spa.

11:14.332 --> 11:15.932
Hey, you deserve
it, buddy.

11:15.934 --> 11:18.401
So just relax, take
your glasses off,

11:18.403 --> 11:20.169
take a nice,
dry sauna--

11:20.171 --> 11:21.571
no glasses in
the sauna--

11:21.573 --> 11:22.772
just leave those
puppies in the locker.

11:22.774 --> 11:24.107
They'll be safe
out here.

11:24.109 --> 11:26.075
Sounds good.

11:33.785 --> 11:35.852
(quietly): Come on, Chris.
Don't let me down.

11:35.854 --> 11:37.120
CHRIS:
Don't worry, Stewie.

11:37.122 --> 11:39.255
Chris! What are you
doing in here?

11:39.257 --> 11:40.423
I did it.

11:40.425 --> 11:41.758
I locked us in the sauna!

11:41.760 --> 11:42.759
You what?!

11:42.761 --> 11:44.160
Yep, it's all set.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.595
It's turned up high,

11:45.597 --> 11:48.564
and nobody is coming
for the whole weekend.

11:49.634 --> 11:51.134
(pounding)

11:51.136 --> 11:53.369
(gasping, panting)

11:54.839 --> 11:57.540
Boy, you guys sure
look steamed.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.176
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This</i> Family Guy<i> joke was</i>
<i>written by Jimmy Sullivan,</i>

12:00.178 --> 12:02.278
<i>age nine, of Decatur, Georgia.</i>

12:02.280 --> 12:04.013
<i>Thanks, Jimmy!</i>

12:04.015 --> 12:07.083
<i>And we'll pass along your</i>
<i>gross request to Mila Kunis.</i>

12:10.155 --> 12:12.021
(water dripping)

12:12.023 --> 12:15.058
(footsteps approaching)

12:15.060 --> 12:16.993
Those footsteps
are getting closer.

12:16.995 --> 12:18.194
Those aren't footsteps.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.729
It's an old building.
Just relax.

12:19.731 --> 12:21.464
Besides, I can see an exit door
right there.

12:21.466 --> 12:23.066
Where?
Right there.

12:23.068 --> 12:24.233
Behind that guy with the hook...

12:24.235 --> 12:25.802
(terrified screaming)

12:29.307 --> 12:30.973
(screaming)

12:30.975 --> 12:32.875
Everybody run!

12:33.712 --> 12:35.978
(Joe screaming)

12:37.682 --> 12:39.615
(thunder crashes)

12:41.486 --> 12:42.819
(screams)

12:42.821 --> 12:44.087
Wait a minute.

12:44.089 --> 12:46.022
There's four of us,
and one of him.

12:46.024 --> 12:47.990
Yeah, let's get him!

12:48.660 --> 12:50.626
(yelling)

12:51.529 --> 12:52.762
Son of a bitch!
Take that!

12:52.764 --> 12:54.964
Die, Hook-hand!
You won't kill us!

12:59.437 --> 13:03.773
Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert,
and he's dressed like a janitor.

13:03.775 --> 13:07.276
(groans)
I've been trying to help you.

13:07.278 --> 13:09.912
I'm the caretaker here.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.180
Wait, you work here?

13:11.182 --> 13:12.415
But you have
a hook hand.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.016
I was a soldier.

13:14.018 --> 13:17.587
I lost my hand
saving six men in Korea.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.856
Oh, God, he's
a war hero.

13:19.858 --> 13:21.958
(exhales)

13:21.960 --> 13:23.559
He's dead.

13:23.561 --> 13:24.861
What have we done?

13:24.863 --> 13:27.263
We killed
an innocent man.

13:31.569 --> 13:35.204
Well, if this doesn't justify
a McFlurry, nothing does.

13:44.048 --> 13:46.983
Oh, my God,
we killed an innocent man.

13:46.985 --> 13:48.451
W-We've got to
report this!

13:48.453 --> 13:49.886
We gotta turn
ourselves in!

13:49.888 --> 13:51.154
No way.

13:51.156 --> 13:52.722
If we do that,
we'll all go to jail.

13:52.724 --> 13:54.123
And I'm a cop.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.825
Do you know what they
do to cops in jail?

13:55.827 --> 13:58.294
Hey, man, when you were
a cop, did they...

13:58.296 --> 13:59.762
did they let you
use the siren?

13:59.764 --> 14:01.397
Yeah, it's part
of the job.

14:01.399 --> 14:02.565
That's so cool!

14:02.567 --> 14:03.966
Hey, hey, when
you were a cop,

14:03.968 --> 14:05.501
when you were going
to a crime scene,

14:05.503 --> 14:06.969
did you go "chung chung,"
like<i> Law & Order?</i>

14:06.971 --> 14:08.671
No, that would be
very unprofessional.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.306
All right,
all right.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.974
Oh, hey, check it out,
man, when you were a cop,

14:11.976 --> 14:13.976
did you ever, you know,
use your handcuffs

14:13.978 --> 14:16.012
when you were getting
kinky with your girl?

14:16.014 --> 14:17.413
No, it's city property,

14:17.415 --> 14:18.915
so you're not really
supposed to take those home.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.082
Oh, for sure, for sure.

14:20.084 --> 14:21.584
Oh, hey, by the way,

14:21.586 --> 14:23.753
a bunch of us are gonna kill
you in the shower later.

14:27.192 --> 14:29.759
Okay, so we're all on
the same page, right?

14:29.761 --> 14:30.927
We bury the body,

14:30.929 --> 14:32.295
we never speak
of this again.

14:32.297 --> 14:34.397
Deal.
Got it.
Yup.

14:40.972 --> 14:43.639
Wow, that was exhausting.

14:43.641 --> 14:46.175
Wait a minute, is-is
that... is that his car?

14:57.555 --> 14:58.821
(car alarm wailing)

14:58.823 --> 15:00.690
Aw, crap, it's still alive!

15:09.834 --> 15:13.436
It does not feel
like a Wednesday.

15:18.977 --> 15:21.043
Peter, I'm glad
you're up.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.179
I need to talk to you
about something.

15:23.181 --> 15:25.414
I know what you did
last night.

15:26.351 --> 15:27.550
You do?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.919
How could you do
something so heinous?

15:29.921 --> 15:31.888
Last night,

15:31.890 --> 15:34.056
you left your dirty dishes
in the sink.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.325
It's disgusting.

15:36.327 --> 15:39.328
So I did half, and I left
the other half for you.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.598
Ah, forget it.
You'll just do it wrong.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.066
I'll wash 'em myself.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.202
Why don't you just go
in the other room and relax?

15:46.204 --> 15:47.904
I'll call you
when breakfast is ready.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.405
Okay.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.042
LOIS: Oh, my God, Peter,
come look at the newspaper!

15:53.044 --> 15:54.543
"Janitor dead."

15:54.545 --> 15:55.344
(gasps)

15:55.346 --> 15:56.712
What? No!

15:56.714 --> 15:59.715
Right here.
My college roommate, Jan Itter.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.617
She passed away yesterday.

16:01.619 --> 16:03.352
Are-are we really
doing this?

16:03.354 --> 16:05.021
'Cause I didn't get, like,
any sleep last night.

16:05.023 --> 16:06.522
What are you
freaking out about?

16:06.524 --> 16:08.024
You didn't even know her.

16:08.026 --> 16:10.159
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
y-you're right, you're right.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.930
LOIS: You and the guys
killed and buried a man?!

16:13.932 --> 16:15.765
Ah, I knew
you'd find out!

16:15.767 --> 16:17.400
Find out what?

16:17.402 --> 16:18.868
I just got
David Sedaris' new book,

16:18.870 --> 16:20.970
<i>You and the Guys Killed</i>
<i>and Buried a Man.</i>

16:20.972 --> 16:22.638
Okay, I am
really on edge

16:22.640 --> 16:24.774
and this thing we're doing,
I'm not happy about it,

16:24.776 --> 16:27.209
and that's a very odd title
for a humorist's book.

16:27.211 --> 16:28.544
Peter, you're acting
very weird.

16:28.546 --> 16:29.812
Just go in
the other room.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.447
I don't want to go
in the other room.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.115
I want to stay here and
see what you're seeing,

16:33.117 --> 16:35.284
because you're saying
things that I think are

16:35.286 --> 16:37.086
something totally different
than what they are.

16:37.088 --> 16:38.888
Peter, you're gonna
have a heart attack.

16:38.890 --> 16:42.458
I won't say anything.
I'll let you relax.

16:43.494 --> 16:45.394
LOIS: "They found a body
of a war hero

16:45.396 --> 16:47.229
down by the old asylum!"

16:47.231 --> 16:48.998
Okay, that has to be something.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.666
(song playing on radio)
Oh, sorry, Peter,

16:50.668 --> 16:54.170

this old John Mellencamp song.

17:25.269 --> 17:26.836

Yeah?

17:26.838 --> 17:29.038
Aah! Damn it! Aah!

She wanted me to tell
people; I don't know why.

17:37.782 --> 17:39.782
(groaning)

17:43.354 --> 17:46.522
Guys, I'm kind of freaking out
about killing that guy.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.858
Anybody else have
a hard time sleeping?

17:48.860 --> 17:50.860
No, but there's an old

17:50.862 --> 17:52.528
you're not gonna
(bleep) believe.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.729
Wait, w-what's
all this stuff

17:53.731 --> 17:55.164
about you guys
killing someone?

17:55.166 --> 17:56.565
Last night,
at the asylum.

17:56.567 --> 17:57.733
We killed
that war hero.

17:57.735 --> 17:58.901
Whoa, whoa, what?!

17:58.903 --> 18:00.536
You-you really
killed someone?

18:00.538 --> 18:03.005
Holy moly, I don't think
I want to hear this.

18:03.007 --> 18:05.007
Quagmire, you were
there with us.

18:05.009 --> 18:06.208
You're so weird.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.543
Last night, I was
in St. Louis.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.911
I even have
a picture.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.346
See that?

18:10.348 --> 18:11.647
That's yesterday's date
on that newspaper.

18:11.649 --> 18:13.182
On<i> The Quahog Informant?</i>

18:13.184 --> 18:16.018
They sell<i> The Quahog</i>
<i>Informant</i> in St. Louis?

18:16.020 --> 18:17.653
Well, probably, but good
luck with that whole

18:17.655 --> 18:20.523
"you three and not me
killed a guy" thing.

18:20.525 --> 18:22.491
Damn it, that bastard
is bailing on us.

18:22.493 --> 18:25.528
He's a worse accomplice
than Johnny Wind Chimes.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.830
(chimes jingling)

18:27.832 --> 18:29.231
Hey! Shh!

18:29.233 --> 18:32.001
(loudly):
Sorry! It's my chimes.

18:40.178 --> 18:42.511
I hate to frame you like this,
Quagmire, but I gotta.

18:42.513 --> 18:43.913
I can't go to jail.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.582
They'll razz me good
on account of my belly.

18:50.388 --> 18:51.787
Cleveland?

18:51.789 --> 18:52.888
What are you
doing here?

18:52.890 --> 18:54.290
What are you
both doing here?

18:54.292 --> 18:56.125
Joe?
What the hell?

18:56.127 --> 18:57.760
QUAGMIRE:
You backstabbers.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.896
What the hell's
going on?

19:00.898 --> 19:02.364
I'll tell you
what's going on.

19:02.366 --> 19:03.899
Cleveland's trying to frame me.

19:03.901 --> 19:06.402
He's got my miniature
portraits of cool guys.

19:06.404 --> 19:07.970
Peter, those are baseball cards.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.139
Whatever. He's using it
to frame me for murder!

19:10.141 --> 19:11.740
Well, I'm not
the only one.

19:11.742 --> 19:14.577
Joe's got my<i> Sports Illustrated</i>
football phone.

19:14.579 --> 19:17.580
He was using this
as his main phone.

19:17.582 --> 19:19.148
It is a mess over there.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.716
Look at all you
pathetic people,

19:20.718 --> 19:22.218
bringing stuff
to frame each other.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.452
You're supposed
to be friends.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.920
Hey, that's
my shovel!

19:24.922 --> 19:26.655
Damn right!
That's how smart I am.

19:26.657 --> 19:28.257
I only had to bring one thing.

19:28.259 --> 19:30.326
This way, I can dig the hole
and just throw this in.

19:30.328 --> 19:31.760
But once you throw
it in there,

19:31.762 --> 19:33.662
how you gonna get
the dirt back on top?

19:33.664 --> 19:35.764
Give me your shovel!

19:35.766 --> 19:37.433
You're gonna have
to kill me first!

19:37.435 --> 19:39.468
Not with my shovel!
That's brand-new!

19:39.470 --> 19:41.904
