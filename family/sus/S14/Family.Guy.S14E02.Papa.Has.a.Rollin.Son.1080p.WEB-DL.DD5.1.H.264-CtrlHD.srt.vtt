ANNOUNCER:
We now return

00:35.594 --> 00:38.595
to<i> The Autistic Postman</i>
<i>Always Rings 400 Times.</i>

00:38.597 --> 00:41.999
(doorbell rings repeatedly)

00:44.203 --> 00:47.204
So is everybody excited
for Father's Day on Sunday?

00:47.206 --> 00:48.538
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.874
I always try to avoid
Father's Day now.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.876
Every year, I used to take
my dad to the horse track.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.946
Now we just go rooting around
for bargains at the mall.

00:55.948 --> 00:58.615
Oh, this is darling,
isn't it?
Uh-huh.

00:58.617 --> 01:01.618
Glenn, do you think you'd see
my bra through this blouse?
Uh, I don't know.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.620
Is it too sheer?
I don't know
what that means.

01:03.622 --> 01:04.955
Glenn? Do you think
it's too sheer?

01:04.957 --> 01:06.623
I said I don't know!

01:06.625 --> 01:08.291
Hey, Joe, you know,
come to think of it,

01:08.293 --> 01:09.292
I've met
Cleveland's dad,

01:09.294 --> 01:10.961
and my dog slept
with Quagmire's dad,

01:10.963 --> 01:12.629
but I don't know anything
about your dad.

01:12.631 --> 01:13.964
Yeah, is he
still with us,

01:13.966 --> 01:16.633
or is he living in Heaven
with Jesus Christ?

01:16.635 --> 01:18.635
Ugh, save that
for your black friends.

01:18.637 --> 01:20.203
Eh, my dad's out
there somewhere,

01:20.205 --> 01:21.972
but I haven't spoken
to him in years.

01:21.974 --> 01:23.240
What?! Really?!

01:23.242 --> 01:24.908
Sorry, Cleveland,
that was mean of me.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.810
I already forgave you.

01:26.812 --> 01:28.812
But, Joe, why haven't you
seen your dad?

01:28.814 --> 01:31.148
Well, he's a good guy,
but we just drifted apart.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.315
It's no big deal.

01:32.317 --> 01:33.884
It's a very big deal.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.752
My dad's a stinking drunk
who lives in Ireland,

01:35.754 --> 01:37.320
but you got
a perfectly good dad.

01:37.322 --> 01:38.655
You can't waste that.

01:38.657 --> 01:40.390
You gotta call him up
for Father's Day.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.726
Peter, I don't even know
where he is.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.995
Who's ready for another beer?

01:44.997 --> 01:47.330
Hey, Cleveland, weren't you
supposed to buy the next round?

01:47.332 --> 01:49.666
That's a shame Joe
never sees his dad.

01:49.668 --> 01:50.667
I know.

01:50.669 --> 01:51.668
Hey, you know what?

01:51.670 --> 01:53.003
Joe's our friend.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.671
He should be with his dad
on Father's Day,

01:54.673 --> 01:56.006
and we're gonna
track him down.

01:56.008 --> 01:58.008
Yeah, that's a
good idea, Peter.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.676
Well, I like
helping people out.

01:59.678 --> 02:02.245
That's why I was such a good
break-up rodeo clown.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.247
I'm just gonna go
ahead and tell you.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.582
I've been sleeping
with your sister.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.917
What?!

02:06.919 --> 02:08.351
Hey, now! Hey, now!
Over here! Over here!

02:08.353 --> 02:10.120
Over here! Hey, now!
Hey, now! Over here!

02:10.122 --> 02:11.455
Over here!
Hey, now! Hey, now!

02:11.457 --> 02:12.456
Over here! Over here!

02:12.458 --> 02:13.523
(growls)

02:15.794 --> 02:17.461
(echoing): Oh, and now that
I'm inside the barrel,

02:17.463 --> 02:20.030
he gave you
and your sister HPV.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.435
Hey, want to see something?

02:25.437 --> 02:27.437
Check out how hot
my last patient was.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.438
Oh.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.439
They look fake.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.474
Yeah, who cares?

02:30.476 --> 02:32.809
Okay, according
to this projection,

02:32.811 --> 02:35.212
Stewie's adult height
will be five-foot-one.

02:35.214 --> 02:36.213
What?!

02:36.215 --> 02:37.948
Five-foot-one?!

02:37.950 --> 02:40.617
Wow, Dr. Hartman,
that's really short.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.954
I mean, I suppose it's fine
if he's gonna die at 14.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.956
Is-is there anything
on there about that?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.624
Well, we learned
in medical school

02:47.626 --> 02:49.292
that the short ones
do go faster,

02:49.294 --> 02:51.328
'cause they smell more farts
than the rest of us.

02:51.330 --> 02:52.329
This is terrible!

02:52.331 --> 02:53.830
I can't be short!

02:53.832 --> 02:57.234
I'll be an outcast, like Rudolph
the Uncircumcised Reindeer.

02:57.236 --> 02:59.236
Look, Rudolph, it's
not me, all right?

02:59.238 --> 03:01.238
It's Dasher, he's
been complaining,

03:01.240 --> 03:03.240
and he is the one who has
to look at it all night.

03:03.242 --> 03:04.574
I don't know.

03:04.576 --> 03:06.910
Mrs. Claus says
it'll decrease my sensitivity.

03:06.912 --> 03:09.913
I-I'm sorry, why are you
talking to my wife about this?

03:13.819 --> 03:15.819
Okay, you guys,
it's all set.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.487
I found Joe's dad
on the Internet,

03:17.489 --> 03:19.823
and he just e-mailed me
to say he's coming tomorrow.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.159
All right, great, but remember,
this is a surprise for Joe.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.493
Why are you
looking at me?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.828
Because you're terrible
at keeping secrets.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.496
No, I'm not;
I'm great at it.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.598
Like when I was
an ob-gyn.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.267
Well, I got the results
of your ultrasound,

03:30.269 --> 03:31.601
and I got some
news for you.

03:31.603 --> 03:32.936
Wait, wait, wait--
(chuckles)

03:32.938 --> 03:34.604
We don't want to know
if it's a boy or a girl.

03:34.606 --> 03:35.939
(chuckling):
Oh, okay.

03:35.941 --> 03:38.275
Well,<i> it's</i>
not breathing.

03:38.277 --> 03:39.276
Hey, guys.

03:39.278 --> 03:41.945
Uh, uh, so, Joe,
big day tomorrow, eh?

03:41.947 --> 03:43.280
Father's Day.

03:43.282 --> 03:45.949
Gonna be home all day,
especially at 11:30 a.m.?

03:45.951 --> 03:47.951
Peter.
What? I didn't say
anything about his dad.

03:47.953 --> 03:48.952
My dad?

03:48.954 --> 03:50.620
What about my dad?

03:50.622 --> 03:54.691
Well, now that Quagmire ruined
the surprise, we found your dad!

03:54.693 --> 03:55.725
You what?!

03:55.727 --> 03:56.893
That's right.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.295
He's coming tomorrow,
for Father's Day.

03:58.297 --> 04:00.297
You shouldn't have
done that, Peter.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.299
My father's not gonna
be happy to see me.

04:02.301 --> 04:03.633
Sure he will.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.302
Just get him one of them
Father's Day cards

04:05.304 --> 04:06.636
what plays a song.

04:06.638 --> 04:07.637
"Dad to the Bone."

04:07.639 --> 04:09.139
"I'm Dad."

04:09.141 --> 04:11.808
Pretty much anything with
"bad," you turn it to "dad."

04:11.810 --> 04:13.810
Wait, w-why wouldn't
your dad be happy?

04:13.812 --> 04:15.312
What, is he a jerk
or something?

04:15.314 --> 04:18.315
No, it's just that
ever since I was a little kid,

04:18.317 --> 04:21.551
he was constantly making fun
of handicapped people.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.887
Really?
Yeah, my whole life,

04:23.889 --> 04:27.224
my-my dad would ridicule
anyone in a wheelchair.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.559
It was all,
"Hey, spaghetti legs!"

04:29.561 --> 04:31.895
And, "Hey, rigatoni legs!"

04:31.897 --> 04:34.564
And, uh, "Hey, angel-hair legs!"

04:34.566 --> 04:37.601
He was a sales manager
at Ronzoni.

04:37.603 --> 04:39.936
Wow, then it must have been
hard for him to accept

04:39.938 --> 04:41.271
when you were
paralyzed.

04:41.273 --> 04:42.606
That's just it.

04:42.608 --> 04:44.941
My dad doesn't know
I'm handicapped.

04:44.943 --> 04:46.343
I never told him.

04:46.345 --> 04:49.679
(sobbing): I never...
I never told him!

04:49.681 --> 04:51.414
(cries)

04:51.416 --> 04:52.749
Ah, Joe, don't cry.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.217
It's gonna make me cry.

04:54.219 --> 04:55.418
(wails)

04:55.420 --> 04:57.087
I cry like Snoopy.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.455
(wails)

05:04.863 --> 05:08.064
I can't believe you invited
my father without telling me.

05:08.066 --> 05:09.933
You guys got to get
in touch with him

05:09.935 --> 05:11.201
and tell him
not to come.

05:11.203 --> 05:12.869
It's too late, Joe,
he's already on his way.

05:12.871 --> 05:13.870
He is?

05:13.872 --> 05:15.205
Yeah, we got him
tickets on Kayak.

05:15.207 --> 05:17.207
It is a nightmare
itinerary.

05:17.209 --> 05:19.209
It was, like, 80 bucks,
but he has four stops.

05:19.211 --> 05:21.044
Two of them are
in Houston.

05:21.046 --> 05:22.379
What am I gonna do?

05:22.381 --> 05:24.614
My dad has no idea
I'm paralyzed.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.616
Well, there's only
one thing we can do.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.951
We'll just figure out a way

05:27.953 --> 05:29.719
to hide your handicap
from your dad.

05:29.721 --> 05:31.721
Hide the fact
that I can't walk?

05:31.723 --> 05:33.390
Peter, that'll
never work.

05:33.392 --> 05:34.391
It's worth a try.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.059
Come on, Joe,
don't be so negative.

05:36.061 --> 05:37.861
You're like a Boston
fortune cookie.

05:39.498 --> 05:40.830
"I don't know, numbnuts.

05:40.832 --> 05:43.733
Maybe buy a garage and fill it
with hockey equipment."

05:43.735 --> 05:45.168
Huh.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.170
Well, let's see
what my lucky numbers are.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.506
"Screw you, math dick."

05:49.508 --> 05:52.142
Well, that wasn't
very helpful at all.

05:57.082 --> 05:58.281
Here you go, Stewie.

05:58.283 --> 06:00.417
I know clothes shopping
always cheers you up.

06:00.419 --> 06:03.019
I can't believe I'm only
going to be five-foot-one.

06:03.021 --> 06:04.654
Aw, come on, look
at the bright side.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.756
You'll be in the front row
of every class picture.

06:06.758 --> 06:08.024
Holding that little plaque.

06:08.026 --> 06:09.259
You suck.

06:09.261 --> 06:11.127
Why don't you go drink out
of the fountain?

06:11.129 --> 06:12.429
I'll text you
when I'm done.

06:12.431 --> 06:13.997
I know you're
trying to be rude,

06:13.999 --> 06:16.399
but I am gonna do that,
because I find it enjoyable.

06:20.439 --> 06:22.105
Excuse me, I was
looking at this.

06:22.107 --> 06:24.174
Sorry, I've made a decision
to go for that shirt,

06:24.176 --> 06:25.675
and when that happens,
it is on.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.177
Full throttle, man. Pow!

06:27.179 --> 06:29.179
Wow, you're an energetic
little fellow.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.181
I guess your mommy lets
you drink coffee, huh?

06:31.183 --> 06:33.850
Whoa, whoa, I-I don't put
stimulants in my body.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.185
You know something?

06:35.187 --> 06:36.720
You kind of remind me
of Tom Cruise.

06:36.722 --> 06:37.721
Boom.

06:37.723 --> 06:39.055
(laughs)

06:39.057 --> 06:40.790
You-you got me, man.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.126
(gasps)
Wow, Tom Cruise.

06:43.128 --> 06:46.129
You look, um...
bigger in the movies.

06:46.131 --> 06:47.464
Wh-What are you
doing here?

06:47.466 --> 06:50.467
Oh, I get all my clothes from
out-of-the-way toddler stores.

06:50.469 --> 06:52.469
Ooh, uh, you want
an animal cracker?

06:52.471 --> 06:54.137
Sure, you got
a lion in there?

06:54.139 --> 06:55.805
Oh, no,
I eat those first.

06:55.807 --> 06:58.141
I believe eating
the lions gives me power.

06:58.143 --> 07:01.044
Yeah, I hear you believe
in a lot of crazy stuff.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.712
What'd you get there?
A giraffe?

07:02.714 --> 07:03.713
Yeah.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.714
Good, good.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.715
It's good for eyesight.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.050
Well, you're certainly upbeat.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.052
Let me ask you,
doesn't it bother you

07:09.054 --> 07:11.054
being an adult man
who's that short?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.756
'Cause the doctor says
that's where I'm headed.

07:12.758 --> 07:13.757
Oh, no way, man.

07:13.759 --> 07:16.092
The middle of the word
"short" is "or."

07:16.094 --> 07:17.761
"Or" gives you a choice.

07:17.763 --> 07:20.163
And I choose not to be short.

07:20.165 --> 07:22.565
Wow, you need a road map
for that one.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.566
Hey, hey,
I'll tell you what.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.901
You spend the day with me,

07:24.903 --> 07:26.569
you'll see how great
it is to be short.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.905
You'll feel like
you're discovering a new world.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.573
And you know what's in
the middle of the word "world"?

07:30.575 --> 07:32.075
Um... "or"?

07:32.077 --> 07:33.576
Yes!

07:33.578 --> 07:35.178
The dots have appeared, man,
let's connect them!

07:35.180 --> 07:36.913
(chuckles
uncomfortably)

07:36.915 --> 07:39.516
You're... you're a weirdo,
but let's do this.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.587
All right, check
it out, Bonnie.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.589
This is how we're
gonna fool Joe's dad.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.258
Oh, my God.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.692
Yeah, looks
real, right?

07:49.694 --> 07:52.028
I put this pair of pants
on the front legs of this horse

07:52.030 --> 07:53.363
and strapped Joe
to the front

07:53.365 --> 07:55.365
with his legs tied
behind the horse's neck.

07:55.367 --> 07:58.034
And then we put Cinnamon's head
up the back of Joe's shirt

07:58.036 --> 08:00.270
and simply hid the rest of the
horse behind this curtain.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.604
(horse whinnies)

08:01.606 --> 08:03.540
His breath is very
moist, Peter.

08:03.542 --> 08:06.543
And to induce movement, I'm
gonna snap the horse's balls

08:06.545 --> 08:07.944
with this dampened
kitchen towel.

08:09.214 --> 08:10.213
Aah! Oh, my God!

08:10.215 --> 08:11.548
Holy crap, he's
out of control!

08:11.550 --> 08:13.483
Does it look real?

08:14.653 --> 08:15.652
(screams)

08:15.654 --> 08:16.986
Plan "B"! Plan "B"!

08:17.923 --> 08:20.390
(horse neighing)

08:27.732 --> 08:31.067
(groans) Peter, I'm
afraid this is hopeless.

08:31.069 --> 08:32.402
What, I don't know
what else to do.

08:32.404 --> 08:33.736
I mean, we're not
gonna come up

08:33.738 --> 08:35.405
with something better
than the horse.

08:35.407 --> 08:37.407
Yeah, I guess you're just
gonna have to tell your dad

08:37.409 --> 08:38.741
about your handicap.

08:38.743 --> 08:40.410
I can't do that.

08:40.412 --> 08:43.346
If you guys were in my shoes,
you'd understand.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.348
Wait a minute, that's it!

08:45.350 --> 08:47.350
I<i> will</i> get in your shoes.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.985
I'll just pretend to be you.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.653
I mean, your dad ain't
seen you in years.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.988
He won't know
the difference.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.523
What? That's crazy.

08:53.525 --> 08:54.858
(groaning)

08:54.860 --> 08:56.860
Boy, that was a close call.

08:56.862 --> 08:59.662
Is some of this room cold?

09:03.535 --> 09:04.934
All right, Peter, almost done.

09:07.205 --> 09:08.872
Huh? Huh?

09:08.874 --> 09:09.873
Eh, kind of.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.608
Yeah.
I don't care.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.276
Peter, I don't
know about this.

09:13.278 --> 09:14.611
It seems like
a bad idea.

09:14.613 --> 09:17.280
Look, Lois, Joe is one
of my best friends, all right?

09:17.282 --> 09:18.948
I'm only doing this
to help him.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.517
Besides, wait till you hear
my "Joe" voice.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.620
(imitating Joe): Uh, God, I hate
being stuck in this chair.

09:23.622 --> 09:26.456
No, Peter,
that fights it.

10:17.842 --> 10:18.841
I think so.

10:18.843 --> 10:20.176
What do you think,
acting coach?

10:20.178 --> 10:23.846
I think you will be
exemplary, Peter.

10:23.848 --> 10:26.182
All good acting coaches
are insane old ladies.

10:26.184 --> 10:27.784
Emote!

10:27.786 --> 10:29.786
(doorbell rings)

10:29.788 --> 10:30.787
Hi, Bud.

10:30.789 --> 10:31.788
Hi, Joe's dad.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.122
Uh, I mean, uh, Dad.

10:33.124 --> 10:34.691
Uh, Joe, I'm Joe;
you're my dad.

10:34.693 --> 10:35.758
Joe?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.894
Wow, I guess it really
has been a long time.

10:37.896 --> 10:39.295
I barely recognize you.

10:39.297 --> 10:40.797
Put on a little weight,
haven't you?

10:40.799 --> 10:42.865
Well, I could say
the same for you.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.534
(laughs)
(laughs uneasily)

10:44.536 --> 10:47.537
Sometimes I don't understand
why people laugh.

10:51.209 --> 10:53.109
All right, everyone in the car.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.078
We got a Father's Day
dinner reservation.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.146
Why is Mr. Swanson coming?

10:57.148 --> 10:58.715
And why is he dressed like Dad?

10:58.717 --> 10:59.983
I don't know, kids.

10:59.985 --> 11:03.019
I stopped asking after your
father said he shot a horse.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.455
(siren whoops twice)

11:07.492 --> 11:09.392
Thanks for
the ride-along.

11:09.394 --> 11:11.928
I liked when you sentenced those
two girls to kiss each other.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.564
Yeah, all girls are lesbians
when you point a gun at 'em.

11:14.566 --> 11:16.799
Boy, it's been great
spending time with you, son.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.502
It's been great spending
time with you, too...

11:19.504 --> 11:20.737
Dad.

11:23.241 --> 11:24.741
Oh, this'll be fun.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.075
Let's see how long it takes them

11:26.077 --> 11:27.777
to get Gumby over there
into the car.

11:27.779 --> 11:29.746
Yeah, that's our neighbor,
Peter Griffin.

11:29.748 --> 11:31.247
That's the guy
who e-mailed me?

11:31.249 --> 11:34.283
Huh, no wonder it was all caps
with tons of typos.

11:34.285 --> 11:35.585
He's a water head, right?

11:35.587 --> 11:36.786
Yeah, he's a mess.

11:36.788 --> 11:37.987
Look at his ugly kids.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.922
Pathetic.

11:39.924 --> 11:41.457
Ugh, he's not fitting.

11:41.459 --> 11:44.594
Just put some of him
in the back like skis.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.266
Hey, Stewie.
What's up?

11:50.268 --> 11:51.801
(chuckling): When you
say it like that,

11:51.803 --> 11:53.102
you sound just
like Tom Cruise.

11:53.104 --> 11:54.437
What?
Oh, yeah,

11:54.439 --> 11:55.672
I've been hanging
with Tom Cruise.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.507
You've been hanging out
with Tom Cruise?

11:57.509 --> 11:58.508
Sure have.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.809
We spent the whole
day together,

11:59.811 --> 12:00.977
and he showed me

12:00.979 --> 12:02.445
there's a lot of
advantages to being short.

12:02.447 --> 12:03.613
Oh, yeah? Like what?

12:03.615 --> 12:05.181
You're the last one
to get wet when it rains?

12:05.183 --> 12:06.449
Well, yeah, that.

12:06.451 --> 12:08.551
And you can chow
pie standing up.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.453
We didn't do any of that,
but the point is,

12:10.455 --> 12:12.121
I'm at peace
with being short.

12:12.123 --> 12:13.623
Full throttle, man!
Pow!

12:13.625 --> 12:15.124
(phone ringing)

12:15.126 --> 12:16.459
Hello.

12:16.461 --> 12:18.361
Oh, hi,
Dr. Hartman.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.229
Mrs. Griffin,
I have some good news.

12:20.231 --> 12:22.632
Turns out your son
is going to be normal height.

12:22.634 --> 12:24.667
I read his chart wrong
yesterday.

12:24.669 --> 12:27.870
Apparently, I have something
called "dislooxia"?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.706
That was the doctor.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.642
Apparently, Stewie's not
gonna be short after all.

12:32.644 --> 12:34.177
What? Really?

12:34.179 --> 12:35.545
That's wonderful news!

12:35.547 --> 12:37.013
Oh, I'm so relieved

12:37.015 --> 12:39.148
my child is spared
some heartache.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.651
Now, come on, Brian, I guess
we should try to make it

12:41.653 --> 12:42.819
over to Meg's
birthday party.

12:45.657 --> 12:47.724
Could I have some bread
while I open my presents?

12:47.726 --> 12:49.425
At this point,
we're gonna have to start

12:49.427 --> 12:50.993
charging you
for the bread.

12:50.995 --> 12:52.862
(doorbell rings)

12:52.864 --> 12:53.863
Hey, Stewie!

12:53.865 --> 12:55.064
You want to check out
the go-kart

12:55.066 --> 12:56.332
I used in<i> Days of Thunder?</i>

12:56.334 --> 12:57.567
Yeah, listen, um...

12:57.569 --> 13:00.002
I just found out I'm
actually going to be tall,

13:00.004 --> 13:02.839
so I'm no longer comfortable
hanging out with someone

13:02.841 --> 13:04.674
whose teeth are bigger
than their fingers.

13:04.676 --> 13:05.675
What?

13:05.677 --> 13:07.009
That's...
that's barely true.

13:07.011 --> 13:08.678
Yeah, so...
see you later.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.513
You are making a big mistake,
Stewie!

13:10.515 --> 13:13.850
Nobody walks away
from Tiny Tom Cruise!

13:13.852 --> 13:15.518
Yeah, except for
all three of your wives.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.353
Okay, I'm
shutting this now.

13:17.355 --> 13:20.456
Okay, so... bye!

13:23.962 --> 13:27.597
So now, since I switched
to disposable catheters,

13:27.599 --> 13:30.933
I no longer have those beet-red
infections in my urethra.

13:30.935 --> 13:31.968
Oh, no.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.202
I hope it's not genetic.

13:33.204 --> 13:34.804
Chris, he's
not our dad.

13:34.806 --> 13:36.873
I can't keep up with this ruse.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.374
Hey, everybody!

13:38.376 --> 13:40.109
Peter, finally,
you're home.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.044
How's it going over there
with my dad?

13:42.046 --> 13:43.880
Awesome. He fell for
the whole thing.

13:43.882 --> 13:45.715
In fact, we've been
having a great time!

13:45.717 --> 13:47.383
Wow, that's
terrific, Peter!

13:47.385 --> 13:49.819
You'll only have to pull it
off for a few more hours.

13:49.821 --> 13:52.555
Then he'll be on a plane
tomorrow and I can go home.

13:52.557 --> 13:53.890
Oh, that's
the other good news.

13:53.892 --> 13:55.258
Bud's not leaving!

13:55.260 --> 13:56.926
I told him he can move in
with me and Bonnie.

13:56.928 --> 13:57.927
What?!

13:57.929 --> 13:59.262
Peter, this is crazy!

13:59.264 --> 14:00.897
Nah, it's gonna
work out fine.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.064
Oh, and remember, Joe,

14:02.066 --> 14:03.566
if Lois is feeling
frisky at night,

14:03.568 --> 14:06.068
it's index finger
around and clockwise.

14:06.070 --> 14:07.570
And just keep
doing that to yourself

14:07.572 --> 14:08.738
until you're good to go.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.679
Peter, this is ridiculous.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.816
You can't live in my house
with my dad and my family!

14:19.818 --> 14:22.185
Your dad got me
super clean in the tub.

14:22.187 --> 14:23.986
Joe's right,
this is idiotic.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.321
What are you thinking?

14:25.323 --> 14:26.589
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

14:26.591 --> 14:28.257
I'm thinking that
I've had two dads

14:28.259 --> 14:30.760
and neither one cared for me
as much as Bud does.

14:30.762 --> 14:32.094
Peter, I've had
enough of this!

14:32.096 --> 14:33.663
You can't just
take my dad!

14:33.665 --> 14:34.864
Well, he's right
next door.

14:34.866 --> 14:36.666
Nothing's stopping you
from going over there

14:36.668 --> 14:38.000
and telling him the truth:

14:38.002 --> 14:40.536
that his son is a paraplegic
who's stuck in a wheelchair.

14:40.538 --> 14:41.938
You know I
can't do that.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.673
Ah, suit yourself.
But I gotta go.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.508
Me and Bud are
having a blast.

14:47.145 --> 14:48.611
I'm sorry, Joe.

14:48.613 --> 14:49.946
A-Are you okay?

14:49.948 --> 14:51.314
Not really.

14:51.316 --> 14:53.115
I'll be honest,
Lois, this hurts.

14:53.117 --> 14:54.851
Hurts like the Dickens.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.819
I've finished
my latest novel.

14:56.821 --> 14:57.854
Splendid, Charles!

14:57.856 --> 14:58.855
What is it called?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.056
<i>Oliver Nipple-Twist.</i>

15:00.058 --> 15:01.123
Ow!

15:01.125 --> 15:02.725
Oh, Charles, you bastard!

15:02.727 --> 15:03.960
Yeah! The Dickens!

15:03.962 --> 15:06.195
It hurts like the me!

15:11.636 --> 15:15.137
So, anyone going to
the gerbil's funeral on Friday?

15:15.139 --> 15:16.239
Okay, kids!

15:16.241 --> 15:18.140
Everyone in a circle
for parachute time.

15:18.142 --> 15:21.143
Oh, goodie,
I love parachute time!

15:23.581 --> 15:25.815
ALL:
Whee!

15:25.817 --> 15:27.583
Whee!

15:28.353 --> 15:30.019
Whee!

15:30.021 --> 15:31.687
What the hell?

15:31.689 --> 15:33.990
That kid looked like
Tiny Tom Cruise.

15:33.992 --> 15:35.258
Whee!

15:35.260 --> 15:37.426
Huh.
Must've been my imagination.

15:38.529 --> 15:39.562
Aah!

15:39.564 --> 15:41.530
If you think
you're getting away from me,

15:41.532 --> 15:43.266
you've got a crazy laugh
coming, friend.

15:43.268 --> 15:45.668
(laughs crazily)

15:45.670 --> 15:47.169
Aah!

15:47.171 --> 15:49.238
(continues laughing)

15:54.345 --> 15:55.845
(panting)

15:55.847 --> 15:57.213
Hey, what are you doing home
so early?

15:57.215 --> 15:58.214
He's following me, Brian!

15:58.216 --> 15:59.282
Who's following you?

15:59.284 --> 16:00.516
Tom Cruise!

16:00.518 --> 16:02.184
I spend one afternoon
with the guy,

16:02.186 --> 16:03.853
and it's like I signed
an eight-year contract

16:03.855 --> 16:05.288
to show up at events with him

16:05.290 --> 16:07.023
and let him fake-father a child.

16:07.025 --> 16:08.724
Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise

16:08.726 --> 16:10.860
has better things to do
than follow you around.

16:10.862 --> 16:11.861
Oh, really?

16:11.863 --> 16:12.962
Well, explain that!

16:20.271 --> 16:22.538
You know, it's times
like this where I think,

16:22.540 --> 16:24.774
if I didn't talk and
you were a normal baby,

16:24.776 --> 16:26.542
we wouldn't have
any of these problems.

16:26.544 --> 16:27.877
You gotta help me
get rid of him, Brian!

16:27.879 --> 16:29.545
He's creepier
than that guy at the gym

16:29.547 --> 16:31.547
who just does karate
in the mirror.

16:33.251 --> 16:34.383
It's me.

16:34.385 --> 16:35.384
The guy's me.

16:35.386 --> 16:36.852
I'm a gym karate creep.

16:39.991 --> 16:41.123
I'm pretty good, too.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.291
But relax.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.360
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

16:48.066 --> 16:50.399
Hey, Dad, what do you
say we go play catch?

16:50.401 --> 16:51.567
And throw me
some divers.

16:51.569 --> 16:54.070
I want to get grass stains
on my school slacks.

16:54.072 --> 16:55.104
What?

16:55.106 --> 16:56.272
You're a grown man.

16:56.274 --> 16:58.441
I know, it's just so
great having a dad.

16:58.443 --> 17:00.943
Well, it's nice having
reconnected with you, too.

17:00.945 --> 17:03.546
All right, let's do it.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.253
Oh, for God's sake.

17:11.255 --> 17:13.255
See, a guy like that
should just stay inside

17:13.257 --> 17:14.590
so we don't have
to look at him.

17:14.592 --> 17:15.825
Joe, go over there

17:15.827 --> 17:17.293
and tell him to get
back in his house.

17:17.295 --> 17:19.762
Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

17:19.764 --> 17:20.930
Joe, you gotta go inside.

17:20.932 --> 17:22.198
You're upsetting my dad.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.100
<i>Your</i> dad?
That's right!

17:24.102 --> 17:25.501
He loves me
in a way that...

17:25.503 --> 17:27.169
Aw, you guys had pizza?

17:27.171 --> 17:28.671
Screw you, Peter!

17:28.673 --> 17:30.272
You know what? This is over!

17:30.274 --> 17:31.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:31.476 --> 17:32.475
Not a chance.

17:32.477 --> 17:33.809
I like your house better.

17:33.811 --> 17:35.711
I got nothing to hold onto
when I poop at home.

17:35.713 --> 17:38.280
You have no idea how many shower
curtains I've ripped down.

17:38.282 --> 17:39.281
Now get inside.

17:39.283 --> 17:41.017
No, I'm not
gonna do that.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.218
Oh, yes, you are!

17:42.220 --> 17:44.787
Get away from me,
you son of a bitch!

17:44.789 --> 17:46.622
What the hell?

17:46.624 --> 17:48.357
Joe, don't take that
from him!

17:50.294 --> 17:51.293
(Peter grunts)

17:51.295 --> 17:52.628
How do you like that?

17:52.630 --> 17:54.864
You're getting
your ass kicked by a cripple!

17:54.866 --> 17:57.633
A helpless,
spaghetti-legged cripple!

17:57.635 --> 17:58.701
What are you doing?

17:58.703 --> 17:59.835
You're my son!

17:59.837 --> 18:01.170
You can't let yourself
get beat up

18:01.172 --> 18:02.705
by a guy
in a wheelchair!

18:02.707 --> 18:05.975
Your son is a guy
in a wheelchair.

18:05.977 --> 18:07.743
What are you talking about?

18:09.313 --> 18:11.380
(sighs)

18:12.984 --> 18:14.817
(gasps)
(gasps)

18:14.819 --> 18:15.851
Yes.

18:15.853 --> 18:16.986
Yes, Dad.

18:16.988 --> 18:18.320
It's me.

18:18.322 --> 18:20.022
(grunting)

18:20.024 --> 18:21.357
Joe!

18:21.359 --> 18:22.658
What the hell
happened to you?

18:22.660 --> 18:24.326
I was shot in
the line of duty.

18:24.328 --> 18:26.662
(laughs)
"Line of duty."

18:26.664 --> 18:29.832
So, this is why you haven't
called me in all these years?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.167
How could I, Dad?

18:31.169 --> 18:33.102
You always made fun
of handicapped people.

18:33.104 --> 18:36.605
The only thing I never
understood was... why?

18:36.607 --> 18:38.174
I don't know.

18:38.176 --> 18:39.842
I guess I could
never stand the thought

18:39.844 --> 18:41.343
of something like that
happening to me.

18:41.345 --> 18:44.180
Or even worse, to someone
that I care about.

18:44.182 --> 18:46.282
One time, my legs fell
asleep on the toilet.

18:46.284 --> 18:47.950
I had to crawl
into the living room

18:47.952 --> 18:49.385
and interrupt
Lois' book club.

18:49.387 --> 18:51.787
That was one of the shower
curtains I ripped down.

18:51.789 --> 18:54.223
And I suppose, deep down,
I was afraid.

18:54.225 --> 18:55.858
Afraid that, if it did happen,

18:55.860 --> 18:57.693
I wouldn't be strong enough
to handle it.

18:57.695 --> 19:00.362
Well, Dad, I can tell you
from experience,

19:00.364 --> 19:02.865
it's only when
your worst fears come true

19:02.867 --> 19:06.102
that you get to find out
how strong you really are.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.704
Then I guess I've got
some learning to do.

19:08.706 --> 19:10.306
I love you, son.

19:10.308 --> 19:12.007
I love you, too, Dad.
I love you, too, Dad.

19:16.747 --> 19:18.247
Hey, Joe, uh,
just one question:

19:18.249 --> 19:20.483
why do you have all those
<i>Wizard of Oz</i> plates?

19:20.485 --> 19:22.384
Because if I finish
my vegetables,

19:22.386 --> 19:24.820
I get to see
the Yellow Brick Road.

19:24.822 --> 19:26.889
All right,
you sold me.

19:30.161 --> 19:31.327
All right, Brian,

19:31.329 --> 19:33.229
Tiny Tom Cruise
is somewhere close.

19:33.231 --> 19:34.830
I can sense
his manic energy.

19:34.832 --> 19:36.165
You remember the plan?

19:36.167 --> 19:37.766
Yup, I got it.

19:37.768 --> 19:40.636
Help, help!
My dog got off his leash!

19:40.638 --> 19:43.305
Is there anyone
who can do a pumpy-arm run?

19:44.675 --> 19:47.576
Running, running, running,
running, running, running, run!

19:47.578 --> 19:50.246
Hey, Stewie. I'm here to help
you for the next billion years.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.480
All right, good to know.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.149
Anyway, my dog ran
around those bushes.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.216
I am on it!

19:55.419 --> 19:57.419
Gotcha!

19:57.421 --> 19:59.321
All right,
off to Zappos with him.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.656
You sure this
is gonna work?

20:00.658 --> 20:02.291
Oh, yeah.
They'll accept any returns.

20:02.293 --> 20:04.260
We don't even
have to pay postage.

20:06.130 --> 20:08.264
Hello, friend.
Your life...

20:08.266 --> 20:09.798
is about to change.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.768
Hey, Tom. It's been
a couple weeks.

20:17.041 --> 20:20.276
Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorry
I treated you like such a jerk.

20:20.278 --> 20:21.677
Well, that's okay, Peter.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.613
In fact, I got to say, it
was a nice thing you did.

20:24.615 --> 20:28.017
I'm glad I reconnected with
my dad after all these years.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.618
Ah, it was my pleasure.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.554
There's no more important
relationship than...

20:31.556 --> 20:32.888
I'm sorry, Cleveland,
what the hell

20:32.890 --> 20:34.623
is that
Toronto Raptors hat?

20:34.625 --> 20:35.958
It was my
Father's Day present.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.126
I hate it.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.827
I'm just gonna
wear it for a week,

20:38.829 --> 20:40.162
then say
I lost it.

20:40.164 --> 20:41.964
Anyway, thanks for
helping me, Peter.

20:41.966 --> 20:43.966
Yeah, it all
worked out great, Joe.

20:43.968 --> 20:46.802
Except I am still missing
that one pair of pants.

20:48.739 --> 20:50.806
(tires screech)

20:54.145 --> 20:56.712
Excuse me,
are those Bugle Boy jeans?

20:56.714 --> 20:58.781
