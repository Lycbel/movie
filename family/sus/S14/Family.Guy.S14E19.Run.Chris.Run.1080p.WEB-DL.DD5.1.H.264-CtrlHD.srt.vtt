of nobody joining
us for lunch.

00:39.131 --> 00:40.530

This is Principal Shepherd

with the lunchtime
announcements.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.841
And as a special treat,
I thought I'd deliver them

I can't hear you, I just presume

01:09.028 --> 01:10.494
somebody must have yelled
"You suck."

01:10.496 --> 01:12.329
Anyway, last announcement:

01:12.331 --> 01:15.532
Don't forget it's time to vote
for homecoming king and queen.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.035
Nominations are due
by 3:00 p.m. today.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.202
Peace out.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.039
No,<i> you're</i> a douche bag.

01:22.041 --> 01:25.742
Wow. Can you imagine if one
of us was homecoming king?

01:25.744 --> 01:27.911
Then people would want
to sit with us at lunch.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.746
Yeah, you should run.

01:29.748 --> 01:30.914
I'll nominate you.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.350
You know what?
I'll do it.

01:33.352 --> 01:35.018
Maybe I'll surprise everyone,

01:35.020 --> 01:37.087
like when you find out
a buttoned-up librarian

01:37.089 --> 01:39.356
is actually super sexy.

01:39.358 --> 01:41.191

01:48.767 --> 01:52.002
There's a dead homeless man
blocking the card catalog.

01:55.374 --> 01:58.041
Well, there goes Jerome,

01:58.043 --> 01:59.910
loading the urinal up with ice.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.946
Gonna go play me
my melting game.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.281
Man, I'm starting to get drunk.

02:04.283 --> 02:05.549
Is it even noon yet?

02:05.551 --> 02:07.884
Uh, it's only 10:40.
10:40?

02:07.886 --> 02:09.119
Ah, crap,
we gotta get out of here.

02:09.121 --> 02:10.454

Ooh, man, you're right.

02:15.127 --> 02:16.293
You know,
this is great, guys.

02:16.295 --> 02:17.928
Drinking and
eating garbage.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.330
I'm glad we all took
a mental health day.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.233
Hey, where'd everybody go?

02:23.235 --> 02:24.568
I don't know where they went,

02:24.570 --> 02:26.570
but someone's got
to pay this check.

02:26.572 --> 02:29.573
Damn it. They left without me,
and now I'm stuck with the bill?

02:29.575 --> 02:32.576
Man, who do those guys think
I am, Mark Zuckerbrothers?

02:32.578 --> 02:34.411
Seems like they
do that a lot.

02:34.413 --> 02:36.446
Tell you what,
this one's on me.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.614
Thanks, Jerome.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.748
Since there's
no one here,

02:38.750 --> 02:40.283
do you mind
turning the TV up?

02:40.285 --> 02:43.286
That little Lamisil guy
always makes me laugh.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.655
(laughs)
Yeah.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.794
What do you think he is,
like a Martian?

02:50.796 --> 02:52.062
Like a little
shoe Martian?

02:52.064 --> 02:53.497
I don't know.

02:53.499 --> 02:55.765
I just hope he ain't
down there in my shoes.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.100
No, he's loud.

02:57.102 --> 02:59.436
If he were down there,
we'd know it.

02:59.438 --> 03:02.172

no toenails nohow.

guess what.

03:08.614 --> 03:11.148
I'm running for
homecoming king!

03:11.150 --> 03:12.182
You're what?

03:12.184 --> 03:13.817
Yeah. Neil nominated me.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.819
Why are you home
from school and Meg's not?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.654
(gasps)
Has she taken a lover?

03:17.656 --> 03:20.524
Well, the voting is tomorrow,
so I've got to write my speech.

03:20.526 --> 03:23.960
Luckily, "Chris Griffin"
rhymes with "homecoming king,"

03:23.962 --> 03:25.929
so I've got my opening line.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.298
Oh, my God.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.133
Did you see how
excited he is?

03:30.135 --> 03:31.301
Yeah, isn't that great?

03:31.303 --> 03:32.869
No, it's not great.

03:32.871 --> 03:35.305
Chris is not
homecoming king material.

03:35.307 --> 03:37.007
He doesn't have a
chance of winning.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.642
We got to be at
that school tomorrow

03:38.644 --> 03:40.210
to help pick up the
pieces when he loses.

03:40.212 --> 03:41.311
(bell dings)

03:41.313 --> 03:42.412
Oh, my Hot Pocket!

03:43.048 --> 03:45.215
Ow, it's hot!

03:49.655 --> 03:50.654
(horn honking)

03:50.656 --> 03:52.322
Oh, that must be Jerome.

03:52.324 --> 03:53.557
What the hell
is Jerome doing here?

03:53.559 --> 03:54.958
We didn't order any drinks.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.893
No, he and I got plans.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.728
We're gonna go down
to Carver High School

03:58.730 --> 04:00.897
and look at that mural
of black achievement.

04:00.899 --> 04:04.968
Mm, they got a manila folder
taped over Dr. Cosby's face.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.803
What? Cleveland,
you didn't tell us

04:06.805 --> 04:08.572
you had plans with Jerome.

04:08.574 --> 04:10.073
Some things are
my business.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.409
You don't tell me when
you play with yourself.

04:12.411 --> 04:13.843
Well, if you checked
my Twitter feed,

04:13.845 --> 04:15.478
I wouldn't have to.

04:22.421 --> 04:25.021
(applause)

04:25.023 --> 04:26.990
And if you elect me,
I will be as good

04:26.992 --> 04:29.659
a homecoming king
as a touchdown.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.228
(applause, cheering, whooping)

04:31.230 --> 04:32.896
And our final nominee

04:32.898 --> 04:35.265
for homecoming king
is Chris Griffin.

04:35.267 --> 04:36.733
(scattered clapping)

04:36.735 --> 04:37.901
(microphone feedback squeals)

04:37.903 --> 04:39.236
Thank you.

04:39.238 --> 04:40.737
I'm Chris Griffin.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.773
Webster's dictionary
defines "smegma" as

04:43.775 --> 04:45.742
"a sebaceous,
cheese-like substance

04:45.744 --> 04:48.011
around the head of the penis."

04:48.013 --> 04:50.580
But what is a "king"?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.582
Oh, God,
this is already hard to watch.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.752
Like that<i> Bourne</i> movie where
they couldn't get Matt Damon.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.355
We're facing a biochemical
attack of untold proportions.

04:58.357 --> 05:00.090
Unfortunately,
Jason Bourne is not available.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.758
Who have we got?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.927
We have the sixth-billed
guy from<i> The Avengers.</i>

05:03.929 --> 05:05.862
The arrow guy
who frowns a lot.

05:05.864 --> 05:07.097
Uh, okay.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.465
Does he look
like Bourne?

05:08.467 --> 05:09.933
Yeah, yeah.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.768
He sort of looks
like a young Popeye.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.803
Well, sounds like he's
the right guy for this.

05:13.805 --> 05:16.606
Yeah... yeah.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.608
All right, students.
The votes have been tabulated,

05:18.610 --> 05:21.878
so if you could all look up
from your phones for a minute,

05:21.880 --> 05:23.413
I'll tell you who won.

05:23.415 --> 05:24.781
(rapid clicking)

05:24.783 --> 05:27.617
Children.
A man is talking.

05:27.619 --> 05:28.952
All right, I better
head down there.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.253
I brought a bag
of marshmallows

05:30.255 --> 05:31.888
and a belt for
Chris to bite on

05:31.890 --> 05:33.490
during his meltdown.

05:33.492 --> 05:37.560
And this year's James Woods High
homecoming king is...

05:37.562 --> 05:38.795
Chris Griffin.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.563
(applause)
Yay!

05:40.565 --> 05:43.400
(laughing):
Yay!

05:43.402 --> 05:44.834
Holy crap!

05:44.836 --> 05:46.970
I don't believe it.
Chris won!

05:46.972 --> 05:49.506
All right, now it's time
for these four poor kids

05:49.508 --> 05:51.741
to thank you for
subsidizing their lunches.

05:51.743 --> 05:53.476
ALL (apathetic):
Thank you.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.011
Mean it.

05:55.013 --> 05:56.346
ALL (brightly):
Thank you.

05:56.348 --> 05:57.647
All right.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.049
Time for my car nap.

06:07.759 --> 06:09.326
Hey, hey, hey,
there he is!

06:09.328 --> 06:10.427
The new king!

06:10.429 --> 06:12.262
I already called
and quit my job.

06:12.264 --> 06:14.431
Peter, he doesn't get money
for being homecoming king.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.665
Does he get land?

06:15.667 --> 06:16.933
No, of course not.

06:16.935 --> 06:18.201
Does he get this joke?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.337
"Shagadelic, baby!"

06:20.339 --> 06:22.038
Austin Powers!

06:22.040 --> 06:24.607
Oh, very good.
Very good, my liege.

06:24.609 --> 06:26.676
Well, Chris, since
you're royalty now,

06:26.678 --> 06:27.944
I made your favorites.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.145
Dinner for breakfast?

06:29.147 --> 06:30.380
That's right.

06:30.382 --> 06:32.382
Pork chops
and French onion soup.

06:32.384 --> 06:33.783
Oh, boy!

06:33.785 --> 06:36.019
Well, as king,
I shall eat this breakfast

06:36.021 --> 06:39.022
on a tray in front
of<i> Wheel of Fortune.</i>

06:39.024 --> 06:42.025
I'll get the TV tray,
Your Majesty.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.394
How does nobody see what's going
on with this Chris thing?

06:44.396 --> 06:45.695
What are you talking about?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.230
Well, it's obvious.

06:47.232 --> 06:49.199
The only reason they
elected him king

06:49.201 --> 06:51.634
is because they're gonna
prank him at homecoming.

06:51.636 --> 06:53.403
Shut up, Hat.
That's my brother.

06:53.405 --> 06:55.038
They're not gonna mess with him.
He's the man.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.574
He's got real Griffin beef
in those trousers.

06:57.576 --> 06:59.142
Meg, how can you be so sure?

06:59.144 --> 07:00.877
Because this kind of stuff
happens all the time

07:00.879 --> 07:02.245
to unpopular kids.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.880
They're just trying
to embarrass him

07:03.882 --> 07:05.315
and make him look stupid.

07:05.317 --> 07:06.716
You don't really think
they're going to pull

07:06.718 --> 07:07.851
a prank on Chris,
do you?

07:07.853 --> 07:09.652
I don't know,
but if they are,

07:09.654 --> 07:11.388
we got to get down to that
school and talk 'em out of it.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.655
Good idea.

07:12.657 --> 07:13.890
And luckily,
I'm great at connecting

07:13.892 --> 07:15.392
with that generation.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.395
Like when I went on that
campout with One Direction.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.030
So they checked
into their hotel suite,

07:21.032 --> 07:23.933
but the minibar had no
sparkling water-- only still!

07:23.935 --> 07:25.168
(all gasp)

07:25.170 --> 07:26.569
Ah, stop. It's too scary.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.238
Oh, but that's not all.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.572
They looked
in the wardrobe

07:29.574 --> 07:31.341
and discovered
that the stylist

07:31.343 --> 07:33.109
had only brought
non-skinny jeans!

07:33.111 --> 07:34.577
(all gasp)

07:34.579 --> 07:36.746
Do mean like a
Levi's 513 skinny straight?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.915
No. Just regular
pants that fit normal!

07:38.917 --> 07:40.417
(all gasp)

07:40.419 --> 07:42.585
That's not real, right?
Those aren't real?

07:42.587 --> 07:44.354
Of course not, Louis.
It's-it's just a story.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.256
Well, I guess that means
these aren't real!

07:46.258 --> 07:47.590
(all screaming)

07:47.592 --> 07:49.259
Yeah, they're gonna die
in the woods.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.760
Simon, are they tagged?

07:50.762 --> 07:51.961
They're tagged, right?

07:51.963 --> 07:53.863
Oh, they're tagged.
Good.

07:53.865 --> 07:55.098
Simon, did I ever
tell you the one

07:55.100 --> 07:56.766
about the
loose-fitting T-shirt?

07:56.768 --> 07:59.702
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

08:03.708 --> 08:05.041
All right,
if we want Cleveland

08:05.043 --> 08:06.709
to stop spending
all his time with Jerome,

08:06.711 --> 08:08.144
we got to remind him
how much fun<i> we</i> are.

08:08.146 --> 08:09.446
So let's just have fun.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.613
How do we do that?

08:10.615 --> 08:11.815
I don't know.

08:11.817 --> 08:13.783
Little bit of this.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.485
Okay.
That seems like fun.

08:15.487 --> 08:17.120
What about one of these?

08:17.122 --> 08:18.488
Yeah, sure.
There's no wrong moves.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.457
What if I brush
my shoulders off?

08:20.459 --> 08:23.226
Original ideas
are preferred, but sure.

08:23.228 --> 08:25.962
Three fun guys,
room for four.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.130
I don't know if
it's working, Peter.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.298
I don't know
if it's fun.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.133
It's more than fun,
it's "foon."

08:30.135 --> 08:31.801
That's a fun way
to say "fun."

08:31.803 --> 08:34.471
Hey, how foon would it be
if we waved sticks around?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.406
I-I really don't know
what we're doing.

08:36.408 --> 08:38.007
It's foon,
from the word before.

08:38.009 --> 08:39.909
I don't see what's...
(yells)

08:39.911 --> 08:42.679
All right, first,
let's take your blood pressure,

08:42.681 --> 08:44.180
'cause that's-that's
like our favorite thing

08:44.182 --> 08:46.049
to do around here.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.921
Okay, we all know how much
Cleveland loves<i> Tecmo Bowl,</i>

08:51.923 --> 08:53.323
so let's start playing.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.524
I'm the Raiders.
I'm Bo Jackson.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.025
And hopefully,
he'll show up.

08:56.027 --> 08:57.827
That's no fair.
Bo Jackson's too fast.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.863
Guys, do we want
Cleveland back or don't...

08:59.865 --> 09:01.097
Uhp, here we go.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.500
PETER (laughs):
Bye-bye.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.767
QUAGMIRE:
See, Peter? He's too fast.

09:04.769 --> 09:06.169
You got to tackle me.
It's "B."

09:06.171 --> 09:07.670
You got to press "B."

09:07.672 --> 09:09.339
I'm pressing "B." He's too fast.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.940
Going over here.

09:10.942 --> 09:12.275
Going over here now.

09:12.277 --> 09:13.510
Never get tired.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.678
JOE:
Change your guy, Quagmire.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.880
Change your guy.

09:16.882 --> 09:18.147
I'm trying.
Peter's cheating.

09:18.149 --> 09:19.516
You're cheating, Peter.

09:19.518 --> 09:20.783
I'm not cheating.
I'm following the rules.

09:20.785 --> 09:22.185
I'm just really good.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.521
You're not really good.
You just got Bo Jackson.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.524
Bo Jackson also played
professional baseball.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.526
Shut up, Joe.
Everybody knows that.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.693
Kansas City.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.861
Royals.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.696
Can't stop.
Won't stop.

09:33.698 --> 09:38.368
Bo... might...
go... all... the...

09:38.370 --> 09:40.203
Nope, going back
the other way.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.071
What? Are you going backwards?
Just score.

09:42.073 --> 09:43.907
Nah, I'm gonna run
out the quarter.

09:43.909 --> 09:46.042
I'm not playing now.
My controller's down.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.977
(quietly):
Seems like your controller's
been down the whole time.

09:47.979 --> 09:50.914
Who's Veris?
You got to switch off Veris.

09:50.916 --> 09:53.149
Get it to Ronnie Lott.

09:53.151 --> 09:55.985
Pretty much anyone
but Veris.

09:55.987 --> 09:58.721
Oh, no, I'm all the
way back here now.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.823
I'm in my own end zone.
What am I doing?

10:00.825 --> 10:02.559
Too bad I'm not
Bo Jackson.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.760
Oh, wait. I am!

10:03.762 --> 10:05.094
Ridiculous.

10:05.096 --> 10:06.896
Oh, yeah.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.331
There you go,
Quagmire.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.566
You're about
to tackle me.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.900
But then...

10:10.902 --> 10:12.902
Damn it!

10:12.904 --> 10:14.070
Less than a minute.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.405
Shut up, Joe!

10:15.407 --> 10:16.573
He's gonna do it.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.840
He might do this.

10:17.842 --> 10:19.008
I don't know, a
lot of football

10:19.010 --> 10:20.176
still to be
played here.

10:20.178 --> 10:21.411
I'm hitting reset.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.745
Don't you dare
hit reset.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.080
You hit reset, you're
banned for life.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.281
I hate this.

10:25.283 --> 10:26.749
Joe, do you want to play?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.751
Nah, I like being
this guy.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.254
A zig. A zag.
A touchdown!

10:31.256 --> 10:33.590
Yeah!

10:33.592 --> 10:34.924
♪ I won the game ♪

10:34.926 --> 10:36.526
♪ And now I'm gonna jump ♪

10:36.528 --> 10:37.994
♪ Bo Jackson! ♪

10:39.698 --> 10:41.531
All right, if we want
to get Cleveland back,

10:41.533 --> 10:43.299
we should just put out
his favorite snack:

10:43.301 --> 10:44.801
an open can of tuna.

10:44.803 --> 10:47.704
Often he'll come running
when he hears a can opening.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.372
Peter, stop.

10:49.374 --> 10:50.974
Yeah, I think it's
time we addressed

10:50.976 --> 10:52.609
the elephant
in the room.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.077
There's a simple reason

10:54.079 --> 10:56.546
Cleveland is hanging out
with Jerome and not us.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.414
Jerome is black
and we're not.

10:58.416 --> 10:59.782
Yeah, I mean,
you can't blame him.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.551
It's just a thing
they have in common.

11:01.553 --> 11:02.952
Something they can bond over.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.554
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

11:04.556 --> 11:06.656
I suppose people do want
to be with their own kind.

11:06.658 --> 11:09.659
Like the audience at a
Decemberists concert.

11:09.661 --> 11:11.461
Good evening,
white guys who weigh less

11:11.463 --> 11:13.162
than their girlfriends.

11:13.164 --> 11:15.398
(cheering)

11:19.070 --> 11:21.004
(indistinct chatter)

11:21.006 --> 11:22.639
God, a lot
of gym teacher

11:22.641 --> 11:24.574
suicide memorials
in this place.

11:24.576 --> 11:26.309
All right, let's find
the coolest kids here,

11:26.311 --> 11:28.411
and see if they know anything
about a prank on Chris.

11:28.413 --> 11:30.647
Those chicks in the
skirts look pretty cool.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.182
Hey there.
Brian Rockwell.

11:33.184 --> 11:34.917
This is my friend,
Stewie Goldberg.

11:34.919 --> 11:36.319
What?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.587
I don't know my way
around the school,

11:37.589 --> 11:38.688
so I figured I'd get the deets

11:38.690 --> 11:39.822
from a couple of seniors.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.024
Download me.

11:41.026 --> 11:42.659
Brian-- it's not
Goldberg, by the way--

11:42.661 --> 11:43.826
we should ask
about the prank.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.328
I'm earning their trust.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.596
Hey, uh, I'm new here,

11:46.598 --> 11:48.164
but you know what'd be crazy?

11:48.166 --> 11:49.499
If me, a guy,

11:49.501 --> 11:51.534
went in the girls' room
with you two.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.836
(laughing):
I mean, that would be,
that would be so wild.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.672
We should, we should
totally just go in there.

11:55.674 --> 11:56.873
Brian, stop.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.041
That'd be hilarious.

11:58.043 --> 11:59.275
I'm in.

11:59.277 --> 12:00.677
Stewie, go wait
in the car.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.512
No, we are here to get
information about Chris.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.614
I said, go wait
in the (bleep) car.

12:08.053 --> 12:10.453
They had security guards
in the bathroom.

12:10.455 --> 12:13.756
We-we live in such
a culture of fear now.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.794
(knocking)

12:17.796 --> 12:20.363
Hey, guys, what are
you doing here?

12:20.365 --> 12:22.065
And why are you
dressed like that?

12:22.067 --> 12:23.966
Well, we realized you like
hanging out with Jerome

12:23.968 --> 12:25.401
because he's black,

12:25.403 --> 12:28.071
so we wanted you to know
we can be black guys, too.

12:28.073 --> 12:31.074
Yeah, in fact, we can even
be famous movie black guys.

12:31.076 --> 12:32.375
I'm Bagger Vance.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.143
I also am
Bagger Vance.

12:34.145 --> 12:36.212
I'm Kazaam from<i> Kazaam.</i>

12:36.214 --> 12:37.814
You really think
I'm only hanging out

12:37.816 --> 12:39.649
with Jerome 'cause he's black?

12:39.651 --> 12:42.819
I hang out with Jerome because,
unlike some people,

12:42.821 --> 12:45.388
he actually takes
an interest in my life.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.223
And he would never
stick me with the bill

12:47.225 --> 12:49.392
by walking out
on me at the Clam.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.229
Well, we could have come over
and graciously apologized,

12:53.231 --> 12:54.831
but we took a chance.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.966
That's what I like about us.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.673
Sucks we didn't find
out what kind of prank

13:03.675 --> 13:05.007
they're gonna
pull on Chris.

13:05.009 --> 13:06.576
I know that book
is<i> The Hunger Games</i>

13:06.578 --> 13:07.910
with the cover taken off.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.746
Oh, look, something on TV.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.749
And finally, tonight, a moving
story from James Woods High,

13:12.751 --> 13:16.018
where the student body has made
their homecoming a special event

13:16.020 --> 13:18.221
for a very special boy.

13:18.223 --> 13:19.756
And this year's James Woods High

13:19.758 --> 13:23.426
homecoming king is...
Chris Griffin.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.528
Yay!

13:25.530 --> 13:27.964
(laughing):
Yay!

13:27.966 --> 13:29.432
TOM:
That's right. Chris Griffin,

13:29.434 --> 13:31.768
a tubby spaz
with a heart full of dreams,

13:31.770 --> 13:33.770
gets to feel normal for a night,

13:33.772 --> 13:35.972
thanks to the kindness
of his peers.

13:35.974 --> 13:38.808
BOTH:
Oh.

13:38.810 --> 13:40.209
I just see him
walking around

13:40.211 --> 13:41.978
with his hands down
his pants all day,

13:41.980 --> 13:43.780
and he's just so
fat and weird,

13:43.782 --> 13:45.548
so we feel bad.

13:45.550 --> 13:49.152
Yeah, last year we did the burnt
up kid, so this was a slam dunk.

13:49.154 --> 13:51.387
Oh, my God, they just
elected him out of pity,

13:51.389 --> 13:53.222
because they think he's
mentally challenged.

13:53.224 --> 13:55.825
Kind of like we did
with George W. Bush.

13:55.827 --> 13:58.060
(chuckling):
Huh? Right?

13:58.062 --> 14:00.730
(sighs)
I-I guess.
I guess, Brian.

14:00.732 --> 14:02.131
I-I don't--
I don't know.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.299
Let's-let's just watch
some commercials.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.308
Well, that explains it.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.743
The only reason Chris
is homecoming king

14:13.745 --> 14:15.745
is that all the other
kids feel sorry for him.

14:15.747 --> 14:16.979
Do you think he knows?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.147
I can't imagine.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.348
And we can't tell him.

14:19.350 --> 14:20.650
It would destroy him.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.319
(imitating trumpet fanfare)

14:23.321 --> 14:24.487
Look away!

14:24.489 --> 14:26.989
No one may meet
the king's gaze.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.491
So, uh, hey,

14:28.493 --> 14:30.660
congratulations
again on that, uh,

14:30.662 --> 14:32.028
homecoming thing.

14:32.030 --> 14:33.663
Why congratulate
me on a right

14:33.665 --> 14:35.598
and natural
turn of events?

14:35.600 --> 14:36.933
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

14:36.935 --> 14:38.367
I shall select
three things

14:38.369 --> 14:40.937
from Stewie's room
that I wish to be mine.

14:40.939 --> 14:43.439
There's a book in there
on how to eat healthy.

14:43.441 --> 14:45.608
Why don't you take that,
you fat bitch?

14:45.610 --> 14:48.010
Well, he obviously doesn't
know it's just a pity vote.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.012
In fact, this whole
homecoming king thing

14:50.014 --> 14:52.114
seems to have just gone
straight to his head.

14:52.116 --> 14:54.050
I know, he's acting like
an arrogant jerk.

14:54.052 --> 14:55.551
CHRIS (distant):
Quiet, Rupert!

14:55.553 --> 14:57.720
It is an honor to serve
the king in this manner.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.955
Brian, this can't go on.

14:58.957 --> 15:00.690
Chris is out of control.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.526
He's even more arrogant
than an actor/writer/director.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.195
Well, my script is brilliant,
and I'm a great director.

15:06.197 --> 15:10.032
The question is,
how bad do I want this part?

15:11.703 --> 15:14.136
(crying):
Okay, I'll do it.

15:18.810 --> 15:19.976
Well, now we know.

15:19.978 --> 15:22.044
Neither of us
likes crepes.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.547
See, that's another thing
we got in common.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.582
In fact, you want
to hear something crazy?

15:26.584 --> 15:29.552
Peter and the fellas think that
you and I only hang out together

15:29.554 --> 15:31.153
because we're both black.

15:31.155 --> 15:32.388
Uh-huh.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.923
But I told them
that's insulting.

15:33.925 --> 15:35.258
Why is that insulting?

15:35.260 --> 15:36.926
People like to be
with their own.

15:36.928 --> 15:39.061
I mean, you don't think I
hang out with you because

15:39.063 --> 15:41.831
of your endless stories about
working your remote control

15:41.833 --> 15:45.835
or your fat son or how you once
made a dog shake its head "no"?

15:45.837 --> 15:49.238
I manipulated the
cheeseburger what like this.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.840
You boring, man.

15:50.842 --> 15:52.541
But you're black,
so we cool.

15:52.543 --> 15:54.610
That's racist.
I'm offended.

15:54.612 --> 15:55.912
Whatever.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.580
I'll see you around,
Cleveland.

15:57.582 --> 16:01.617
Man, I guess this whole
friendship was a bad idea.

16:01.619 --> 16:04.854
Just like Goodyear's
advertising strategy.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.856
All right, we have $14 million
to play with.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.758
I say we spend it all on blimps,

16:08.760 --> 16:10.059
'cause who do we want to reach?

16:10.061 --> 16:11.794
Drivers.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.596
And where are people looking
when they're driving a car?

16:13.598 --> 16:15.164
Straight up.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.971
Squire, my chamber pot
needs emptying.

16:21.973 --> 16:23.372
What's he talking about?

16:23.374 --> 16:24.941
He's been pooping
in the waffle iron.

16:24.943 --> 16:25.808
Just plug it in
and close it.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.310
It'll burn off.

16:27.312 --> 16:29.645
Look, Chris, you know,
being homecoming king

16:29.647 --> 16:32.048
doesn't mean you can
just start acting crazy.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.883
I can do whatever I want.

16:33.885 --> 16:37.219
I've been acknowledged
by my peers as their superior.

16:37.221 --> 16:39.322
You're just jealous 'cause
you've never done anything

16:39.324 --> 16:41.290
that deserves
being elected king.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.925
Okay, you want
to know the truth?

16:42.927 --> 16:44.827
They only picked you
because they felt sorry for you.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.128
Sorry?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.730
Why would they
feel sorry for me?

16:47.732 --> 16:50.399
Well, because they all think
you're a, um, you know,

16:50.401 --> 16:54.236
"groundskeeper at a public
institution" kind of guy.

16:54.238 --> 16:55.338
A what?

16:55.340 --> 16:57.640
A dope.
An idiot. A water head.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.242
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

17:00.244 --> 17:02.845
Tonight, when they put
that crown on my head,

17:02.847 --> 17:05.314
it's gonna be the
greatest night of my life.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.718
Even better than when
I had my first kiss.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.927
(phone buzzes)

17:21.833 --> 17:24.867
♪ ♪

17:32.543 --> 17:34.343
I say, we were a
little hard on Chris,

17:34.345 --> 17:35.678
but I'm glad we came.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.213
He's still my brother.

17:37.215 --> 17:38.948
Hey, look, there's
the security guard

17:38.950 --> 17:40.616
that threw me out
of the bathroom earlier.

17:40.618 --> 17:42.284
And he's here
with his wife.

17:42.286 --> 17:44.387
(chuckles) This is like
a date for them.

17:44.389 --> 17:47.056
Good evening,
fingerers and fingerees.

17:47.058 --> 17:48.958
Sorry,
I had a little rum in the car.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.028
Anyway, please welcome your
homecoming king, Chris Griffin.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.596
(applause, cheering)

17:55.800 --> 17:58.200
Good evening, subjects.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.204
The boys' showers shall run red
with the blood of my enemies.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.539
We believe in you!

18:03.541 --> 18:04.540
Good for you, Chris!

18:04.542 --> 18:05.741
No one clap too loud.

18:05.743 --> 18:07.576
We don't want
to frighten him.

18:07.578 --> 18:09.078
Wait a minute.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.212
And now your queen,

18:10.214 --> 18:12.048
prom night car crash victim

18:12.050 --> 18:13.949
Kathleen Fitzpatrick.

18:15.753 --> 18:16.886
ALL:
Aw.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.421
We miss you, Kathleen!

18:18.423 --> 18:20.089
You're heaven's queen now!

18:20.091 --> 18:21.557
BRIAN:
Wow, she was hot.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.726
The queen is a dead girl?

18:23.728 --> 18:25.494
What does that make me?

18:25.496 --> 18:27.596
(gasps)
Brian and Stewie were right.

18:27.598 --> 18:29.498
This was a pity vote.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.900
We love you, Chris!

18:30.902 --> 18:32.268
You love me?

18:32.270 --> 18:34.236
You don't even know
anything about me.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.239
You just voted for me
to make yourselves feel better.

18:39.777 --> 18:42.511
She was on PCP that night,
you idiots!

18:49.454 --> 18:52.021
Chris, I-I'm so sorry.

18:52.023 --> 18:53.189
That's okay.

18:53.191 --> 18:54.924
You guys tried
to warn me.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.625
I'm sorry I was
such a jerk.

18:56.627 --> 18:57.760
Ah, don't worry about it.

18:57.762 --> 18:58.861
Are you okay?

18:58.863 --> 19:01.697
You know what?
I am.

19:01.699 --> 19:03.199
I may not be king,

19:03.201 --> 19:05.434
but I learned
I don't need anyone's pity.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.802
That's the spirit, Chris.

19:06.804 --> 19:08.771
And, hey, you're not
the homecoming king,

19:08.773 --> 19:11.273
but you'll always
be my brother.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.575
Thanks, Stewie.

19:12.577 --> 19:14.110
It means a lot
to me to know

19:14.112 --> 19:16.946
I've always got my family
looking out for me.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.781
Oh, hey, Chris.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.549
This is Tyler.

19:20.551 --> 19:23.219
Don't make this weird now.

19:23.221 --> 19:25.688
(laughs)
Oh, what a gentleman.

19:33.498 --> 19:35.731
Well, Cleveland, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.099
It's good to be back.

19:37.101 --> 19:38.501
Hanging with Jerome was fun,

19:38.503 --> 19:41.137
but my best friends are
right here in this room.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.172
Hey, to celebrate,
how about we play a little

19:43.174 --> 19:45.141
old-school<i> Double Dribble?</i>

19:45.143 --> 19:47.343
Okay, but no stupid-ass
shots from the corner,

19:47.345 --> 19:48.811
because that's a glitch
in the software and...

19:48.813 --> 19:50.112
Game on!

19:50.114 --> 19:52.414
(lively electronic music plays)

19:52.416 --> 19:55.417
PETER: All right, bring it up
the court, and corner three!

19:55.419 --> 19:57.586
CLEVELAND:
No, no. That's what
I'm talking about!

19:57.588 --> 19:59.088
Steal.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.991
Uhp, corner three.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.025
All right, here we go.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.493
I got something cooking.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.495
Uhp, you dropped
something.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.164
Think I'll head over
in this direction.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.498
Corner three!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.100
JOE: It's a rout.
It's a blowout.

20:11.102 --> 20:12.701
It's some bullcrap.

20:12.703 --> 20:14.870
Couple nice passes
there... hey!

20:14.872 --> 20:16.272
PETER:
See? Competitive ball game.

20:16.274 --> 20:17.506
What should I do?

20:17.508 --> 20:18.774
Pass and then go up?

20:18.776 --> 20:21.510
And corner three!

20:21.512 --> 20:23.379
All right, enough
of this mess.

20:23.381 --> 20:25.114
QUAGMIRE:
Shoot it!
Shoot it from there.

20:25.116 --> 20:26.682
JOE:
The refs are lettin' 'em play.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.384
I do appreciate that.

20:28.386 --> 20:29.618
CLEVELAND:
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.886
Now I'm playing
for reals.

20:30.888 --> 20:32.121
PETER:
Yeah, you're doing
pretty good.

20:32.123 --> 20:33.389
What play
should I call now?

20:33.391 --> 20:35.224
Maybe... corner three!

20:35.226 --> 20:36.692
JOE:
He's hot. He is hot.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.360
Keep feeding that guy.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.229
PETER:
Hi, nice to meet you.
Can I have that?

20:40.231 --> 20:41.530
Hang out over here
for a second.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.065
Corner three!

20:43.067 --> 20:44.500
JOE:
You got to get
out there, Cleveland.

20:44.502 --> 20:45.968
I'm trying.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.204
He's taking advantage
of poor technology.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.805
PETER:
Uhp, lot of dribbling. Swipe.

20:49.807 --> 20:51.807
Here we... aw,
I hit the wrong button.

20:51.809 --> 20:54.310
I think you all know I was
going for a corner three.
