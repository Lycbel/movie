Hey, great idea bringing
the couch out here

00:35.594 --> 00:37.327
from your den, Peter.
Yeah, Lois and I

00:37.329 --> 00:39.629
dragged it out here last night
for a little hump sesh,

00:39.631 --> 00:41.264
so I figured I'd let it dry.

00:41.266 --> 00:43.200
"Couch." That's
one of those words

00:43.202 --> 00:44.968
that if you say it
over and over

00:44.970 --> 00:46.336
it starts to sound silly.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.672
Joe, you need to take
a class on small talk.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.341
You're not gonna believe
this-- I'm in one.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.610
It sure is cloudy today.

00:53.612 --> 00:56.113
Good. You could have
also responded to Janet,

00:56.115 --> 00:58.148
who said her son died.

00:58.150 --> 01:02.019
I'm sorry your son died
on such a cloudy day.

01:06.992 --> 01:08.959
All right, kids,
here's your bacon.

01:08.961 --> 01:11.361
I call the
paper towel!
Aw, damn it!

01:11.363 --> 01:14.398
Ha-ha! You got to move fast
when Meg's at the table, Brian.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.334
All right, well, I get the box
when we have pizza for dinner.

01:17.336 --> 01:19.136
(muffled): Uh-uh. It
doesn't work that way.

01:19.138 --> 01:21.304
You got to call it
when it's happening.

01:21.306 --> 01:22.906
Good morning, family.
I'll be out front

01:22.908 --> 01:24.574
with the guys
if anybody needs me.

01:24.576 --> 01:26.243
Peter, I thought
we were gonna try

01:26.245 --> 01:28.145
to get the garden going
again today.

01:28.147 --> 01:31.681
I know, sweetie, but then
I realized how stupid that is.

01:31.683 --> 01:34.518
Okay, bye. You guys
are my everything.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.053
Why'd you ever marry him?

01:36.055 --> 01:39.523
Believe it or not, he used to
look like a young Gene Hackman.

01:39.525 --> 01:42.492
That's... that-that's
not even good.

01:42.494 --> 01:43.660
It's gone!

01:43.662 --> 01:44.995
What? What's gone?

01:44.997 --> 01:47.531
Our drinking couch!
Somebody must've stole it!

01:47.533 --> 01:49.232
You left a couch
out on the curb?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.668
Well, somebody probably thought
it was trash and took it.

01:51.670 --> 01:54.004
You said you were gonna bring
the couch right back in!

01:54.006 --> 01:56.673
What were you thinking?
I'll tell you
what I was thinking.

01:56.675 --> 01:58.842
I was thinking we lived
in a safe neighborhood.

01:58.844 --> 02:00.510
But apparently,
I was wrong!

02:00.512 --> 02:03.513
Wait, you're saying
you were wr-wr...

02:03.515 --> 02:04.748
wr-wro...

02:04.750 --> 02:06.016
wr-wrrr...

02:06.018 --> 02:08.685
Oh, I get it--
the Fonz can't say "wrong."

02:08.687 --> 02:12.022
No, Peter, he's 70--
he's having a stroke.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.695
Wow, Peter, I think
starting a community watch

02:18.697 --> 02:22.099
is a great idea.
Yeah, I even got shirts
made up for us.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.400
This is quality work.

02:23.402 --> 02:25.735
Where did you get these?
Via the Web?

02:25.737 --> 02:26.937
Hey, listen, Joe, um,

02:26.939 --> 02:28.939
you think you
can get us all guns?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.440
No, Peter,
they're too dangerous.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.742
Besides, you can't
just go<i> get</i> a gun,

02:32.744 --> 02:34.945
you have to be certified
in gun safety,

02:34.947 --> 02:37.781
go through an extensive
background screening process.
Got 'em.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.783
Whoa. How'd you
get 'em so quick?

02:39.785 --> 02:42.119
Eh, it was easy-- like
pressing that "easy" button

02:42.121 --> 02:43.954
at the office
supply store.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.789
Hey, thanks
for all your help.
No problem.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.692
Why don't you go ahead
and hit the "easy" button.
Okay.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.796
What did I just do?
Don't worry about it.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.236
Hey, Quagmire,
you're a sex guy.

02:59.238 --> 03:02.439
You watch any good,
uh... pornos lately?

03:02.441 --> 03:04.741
I mean...
I-I guess.

03:04.743 --> 03:06.276
So what's your pleasure?

03:06.278 --> 03:07.944
What kind of
movies you like?

03:07.946 --> 03:10.280
I don't know.
MILF stuff's kind of cool.

03:10.282 --> 03:12.249
What-what about you?

03:12.251 --> 03:14.684
Me? I have very
particular tastes.

03:14.686 --> 03:17.154
I like a soapy bottom.
What?

03:17.156 --> 03:18.822
Soft-core
soaped-up butts,

03:18.824 --> 03:20.824
like from a PG-13
camp movie.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.260
I can't get enough of it.
Drives me wild.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.095
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

03:25.097 --> 03:28.198
All right. Uh...

03:28.200 --> 03:30.367
it's kind of too cool
for the air-conditioner

03:30.369 --> 03:32.335
and too warm for
the heater, huh?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.637
(groans)

03:33.639 --> 03:36.439
Ah, got to walk
that boner off, huh?

03:36.441 --> 03:38.108
Yeah.

03:40.979 --> 03:42.879
Hey, guys, you
better come with me.

03:42.881 --> 03:45.315
There's some weird, big-nose
guy hiding in the bushes

03:45.317 --> 03:47.284
outside some
chick's house.

03:47.286 --> 03:48.652
(whispering
inaudibly)

03:48.654 --> 03:51.154
"My heart always
timidly hides itself

03:51.156 --> 03:52.789
behind my mind."

03:52.791 --> 03:53.990
(whispers)

03:53.992 --> 03:55.992
"I set out
to bring down stars

03:55.994 --> 03:57.294
from the sky..."

03:58.297 --> 03:59.996
(punches landing)
"Ow. Ow.

03:59.998 --> 04:02.866
"Oh, my God,
four men are beating me.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.302
"My arm.
I think it is broken.

04:05.304 --> 04:06.803
"Who are you guys?

04:06.805 --> 04:08.305
"Why? Why?

04:08.307 --> 04:11.808
"I'll give you anything if
you would only stop hitting me.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.810
"Please stop pulling my nose.

04:13.812 --> 04:15.178
"It is not fake.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.013
"I think I am dying.

04:17.015 --> 04:19.649
Please take me to the hospital."

04:19.651 --> 04:21.318
Your words have bewitched me.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.320
I need your arms around me.

04:23.322 --> 04:25.188
(whispers): Come to
my chamber at once.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.723
"Come to my chamber
at once."

04:26.725 --> 04:30.393
And bring pound cake.
"And bring pound cake."

04:34.199 --> 04:35.665
Peter, please
come to bed.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.200
Enough of the
community watch.

04:37.202 --> 04:39.536
We live on a very
safe street.

04:39.538 --> 04:42.005
Lois, you wouldn't believe
the things we see out there.

04:42.007 --> 04:45.008
There was a kid riding his bike
while holding a tennis racket.

04:45.010 --> 04:47.510
For real.
Come on!
Let's fool around,

04:47.512 --> 04:49.012
or watch a movie,

04:49.014 --> 04:51.915
or finally click that
"Crackle" icon on the TV.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.251
Lois, I am
an unelected vigilante,

04:54.253 --> 04:56.519
and I take my job
very seriously.

04:56.521 --> 04:58.521
Like Serious George.

04:58.523 --> 05:00.423
Hey, George, want
to go to the park?

05:00.425 --> 05:02.259
Uh, thank you, but no.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.794
It's a beautiful day--
lots of mischief to get into.

05:04.796 --> 05:06.062
I don't doubt that,

05:06.064 --> 05:08.098
but as you can see,
I'm pretty busy.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.567
I'm trying to get
a head start on my taxes.

05:10.569 --> 05:13.069
Oh, I see-- trying
to figure out a way

05:13.071 --> 05:14.771
to deduct<i> bananas?</i>

05:14.773 --> 05:17.540
Ah. 'Cause I eat
bananas. Terrific.

05:17.542 --> 05:20.110
Hey, your inside,
so don't wear a hat.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.546
Unless you're leaving,
which would be terrific also.

05:23.548 --> 05:25.982
(crickets chirping)

05:27.119 --> 05:28.818
(clacking)

05:31.790 --> 05:33.790
What the hell? Hey, you!

05:33.792 --> 05:35.458
(clacking)

05:35.460 --> 05:37.127
Step away from that table.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.730
(chuckling):
Brain fart. Window. Sorry.

05:41.566 --> 05:42.766
Hold it right there!

05:42.768 --> 05:46.336
I'm warning you!
Hands where I could see 'em.

05:53.412 --> 05:55.412
♪ ♪

05:55.414 --> 05:56.980
Cleveland Jr.?!

05:56.982 --> 05:59.482
Mr. Griffin! You shot me!

05:59.484 --> 06:01.251
Oh, my God!

06:01.253 --> 06:03.286
LOIS (calls):
Peter, where are you?

06:03.288 --> 06:07.757
Peter? Okay, I'm starting
<i>The Good Wife</i> without you.

06:07.759 --> 06:09.092
Phew! Heh.

06:09.094 --> 06:10.860
Unlike you,
I just dodged a bullet.

06:18.503 --> 06:22.305
Okay, next is the...
brown family.

06:22.307 --> 06:24.474
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
I'm-I'm so sorry.

06:24.476 --> 06:26.676
Sometimes I write
descriptions of my patients

06:26.678 --> 06:28.144
to help me
remember them.

06:28.146 --> 06:30.814
No, it's okay.
Our last name is Brown.

06:30.816 --> 06:32.115
(exhales):
Oh, okay. Phew.

06:32.117 --> 06:34.951
Ah, then this must be
"Chubster Dumb-Dumb."

06:34.953 --> 06:36.286
(loud clattering)

06:36.288 --> 06:38.121
NURSE:
I'm sorry, sir. No visitors.

06:38.123 --> 06:41.191
Excuse me, I'll have you know
I'm the shooter!

06:41.193 --> 06:42.792
So, uh, how's he doing?

06:42.794 --> 06:44.994
"How's he doing"?!
How do you think he's doing!

06:44.996 --> 06:46.663
You shot my son!

06:46.665 --> 06:48.164
Look, Cleveland,
I-I'm real sorry.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.301
I thought someone was breaking
into your house, and I panicked.

06:51.303 --> 06:53.069
It was dark. I-I...
I don't know why

06:53.071 --> 06:54.637
he didn't just say
it was him.

06:54.639 --> 06:56.673
I couldn't hear you.
I was listening to music,

06:56.675 --> 06:59.476
I went to turn it down,
and the next thing I know.

06:59.478 --> 07:02.212
you shot me!
Why the hell were you
climbing in the window

07:02.214 --> 07:03.646
of your own house
anyway?

07:03.648 --> 07:05.482
My dad says opening the door

07:05.484 --> 07:07.384
lets out too much
air-conditioning.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.386
I already have a bullet
in my son,

07:09.388 --> 07:11.254
I don't need one
in my wallet.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.890
You wouldn't have fired
that gun if he was white!

07:13.892 --> 07:15.592
That's not true--
I'll shoot anybody.

07:15.594 --> 07:16.993
Joe, give me
your gun.

07:16.995 --> 07:18.395
Here you go...
Hey, wait a second!

07:18.397 --> 07:20.397
Look, let's all just calm down.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.498
Calm down?!

07:21.500 --> 07:23.333
I want this racist
out the room,

07:23.335 --> 07:24.901
and I want him arrested!

07:24.903 --> 07:27.170
Racist? I put these
gloves on for everybody.

07:27.172 --> 07:28.872
Oh, oh, you're
talking to him.

07:28.874 --> 07:31.674
Look, the police department has
deemed the shooting accidental.

07:31.676 --> 07:34.277
Given the circumstances,
Peter was within his rights

07:34.279 --> 07:35.712
to fire his weapon.

07:35.714 --> 07:39.015
And what about my son's rights
not to be<i> shot?!</i>

07:39.017 --> 07:40.517
Look, Cleveland...

07:40.519 --> 07:42.185
Lat... Latisha?

07:42.187 --> 07:44.053
I thought he had a gun.

07:44.055 --> 07:46.856
I'd never want to do anything
to hurt you or your family.

07:46.858 --> 07:47.891
You're my friend.

07:47.893 --> 07:49.058
I<i> was</i> your friend.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.293
Now, get out of here!

07:50.295 --> 07:52.695
You're nothing but
a worthless bigot!

07:55.867 --> 07:57.700
Wow, I really messed up.

07:57.702 --> 08:00.970
I haven't felt this bad since
I drove by that speed sign.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.380
Aw...

08:20.792 --> 08:22.892
Hey, does anybody know
if Cleveland's coming by?

08:22.894 --> 08:25.295
I was hoping to apologize
and collect his deposit

08:25.297 --> 08:28.131
for the community
watch shirts.
I talked to him earlier.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.767
He, uh, he doesn't want
to be anywhere near you.

08:30.769 --> 08:33.069
Hey, look-- they're talking
about the shooting.

08:33.071 --> 08:34.404
Good evening.
Two nights ago

08:34.406 --> 08:37.140
there was a shooting right here
in our own backyard.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.510
The victim: a 14-year-old boy
named Cleveland Brown Jr.

08:40.512 --> 08:43.079
Joining me tonight is
his father, Cleveland Brown.

08:43.081 --> 08:46.149
So that's not really Quahog?
It's just a big picture?

08:46.151 --> 08:48.818
Now, Mr. Brown, I understand
you're trying to get the police

08:48.820 --> 08:50.320
to reopen the investigation.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.755
That's right, Tom.
My family and I believe

08:52.757 --> 08:56.092
this shooting was a hate crime,
and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin

08:56.094 --> 08:58.094
held accountable
for his actions.

08:58.096 --> 08:59.696
Hate crime? That's crazy!

08:59.698 --> 09:01.097
I love<i> all</i> people!

09:01.099 --> 09:03.099
I love blacks, I love Asians...

09:03.101 --> 09:05.468
hell, I even love
gay Aborigines.

09:05.470 --> 09:06.669
(blowing deep tone)

09:07.606 --> 09:09.772
(blowing deep tone)

09:09.774 --> 09:12.842
(electronic dance beat playing)

09:17.449 --> 09:19.949
Wow, this is
just great, Peter.

09:19.951 --> 09:22.185
Everyone in town
hates us now.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.888
The cashier at the grocery store
told her to "push on,"

09:24.890 --> 09:26.389
and then
she snapped her fingers,

09:26.391 --> 09:29.559
and now I think she's my new
favorite lady in the world.

09:29.561 --> 09:32.128
I don't understand.
I'm not a racist.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.464
It's well documented
that my dream three-way

09:34.466 --> 09:37.534
is S. Epatha Merkerson
and CCH Pounder.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.002
S., this is CCH.

09:39.004 --> 09:40.370
CCH, this is S.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.639
It is my intention
that we conduct this

09:42.641 --> 09:45.041
with both sexiness
and dignity.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.743
Peter, this is a
hot-button issue.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.811
I mean, you shot an
African-American kid.

09:48.813 --> 09:51.214
Of<i> course</i> this isn't
just gonna go away.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.816
Well, there's got to be
something I can do
to make things right.

09:53.818 --> 09:56.319
I'll just have
to prove to everybody
that I'm not a racist.

09:56.321 --> 09:58.555
How are you
gonna do that?
Well, for starters,

09:58.557 --> 10:00.356
I'm gonna head over
to the YMCA.

10:00.358 --> 10:02.225
There's nothing
black guys like more

10:02.227 --> 10:05.495
than out-of-shape
indoor-basketball white guys.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.096
(derisive laughter)

10:07.098 --> 10:09.899
Hey! I'm trying
my best here.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.535
And trying is
what matters most of all.

10:12.537 --> 10:13.703
You're right, Peter.

10:13.705 --> 10:15.438
We need to give
you a chance,

10:15.440 --> 10:17.240
no matter what
color your skin is.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.175
Come on, let's
play some ball.

10:20.512 --> 10:23.947
"...and then Peter and his
new friends went for ice cream."

10:23.949 --> 10:25.615
The end.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.452
Okay, kids, are your parents
out of the room?

10:29.454 --> 10:33.756
Good. Let's get back
to<i> Sloppy Floppers</i> magazine.

10:38.229 --> 10:39.729
What are you doing?

10:39.731 --> 10:41.931
Lois, to show I'm in touch
with what it's like

10:41.933 --> 10:44.233
to be African-American,
I am gonna go to the middle

10:44.235 --> 10:47.203
of the town square, get naked
and paint myself brown.

10:47.205 --> 10:49.238
No, no, that's
offensive.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.873
You can't pretend
to be black.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.208
That's a stupid idea.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.943
What?
It's a stupid idea!

10:53.945 --> 10:57.614
You're a stupid man!
A stupid, stupid man!

10:57.616 --> 11:00.450
Ow, you're hurting me!
Stop it, stop it, Lois!

11:00.452 --> 11:03.286
No! I'm so sick
of your crap.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.655
Why do you always
do these stupid things?

11:05.657 --> 11:08.925
And why do you always announce
them to me before you do them?

11:08.927 --> 11:11.494
Are you trying
to get a rise out of me?

11:11.496 --> 11:15.098
Are you happy now?
Is this what you want?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.733
Oh, no,
it's not what I want!

11:16.735 --> 11:20.269
It's not what I want.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:20.271 --> 11:21.638
(Peter sobbing)

11:21.640 --> 11:24.340
It's never been this bad before.
What do we do?

11:24.342 --> 11:26.776
What we always do.

11:26.778 --> 11:30.647
I'm in charge of my head--
that much I know!

11:35.754 --> 11:37.754
What the hell
are you doing on my property?

11:37.756 --> 11:39.822
Look, it's time we
bury the hatchet.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.424
So I brought a bottle
of your favorite booze.

11:41.426 --> 11:43.826
Now let's just have a drink
and put this all behind us.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.495
I don't want
nothing from you.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.296
Well, hold on,
I got something else.

11:47.298 --> 11:49.766
Cigars. We can smoke 'em
together, all happy,

11:49.768 --> 11:51.934
like a bunch of douche bags
outside a wedding.

11:51.936 --> 11:53.202
Peter, get out of here.

11:53.204 --> 11:55.505
I'm never gonna forgive you
for what you did.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.573
Aw, come on.
This'll change your mind.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.412
Oh, my God!
Quick, do something!

12:05.116 --> 12:07.183
It's not working.
Get rid of it!

12:08.653 --> 12:10.019
(all murmuring)

12:13.625 --> 12:14.724
(all gasp)

12:14.726 --> 12:16.392
Get your family
out of that house!

12:16.394 --> 12:18.227
If they don't leave,
they'll die.

12:18.229 --> 12:20.129
Round up your family
and get out

12:20.131 --> 12:21.297
or you're all
gonna be sorry.

12:21.299 --> 12:22.799
Get out, now!

12:22.801 --> 12:24.133
(all gasp)

12:24.135 --> 12:26.169
See, kids, I told you
we'd make friends here.

12:26.171 --> 12:29.005
I guess me getting transferred
by the Xerox Corporation

12:29.007 --> 12:31.474
wasn't the worst thing
after all.

12:31.476 --> 12:33.142
(loud, overlapping shouting)

12:33.144 --> 12:34.644
(siren toots)

12:34.646 --> 12:39.048
(loud, overlapping shouting)

12:39.050 --> 12:41.084
Oh, thank God, Joe.

12:41.086 --> 12:43.720
Are you here to give me the
deposit for the shirts?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.688
No, Peter, I'm here to place you
under arrest

12:45.690 --> 12:47.990
for the attempted murder
of Cleveland Junior.

12:47.992 --> 12:50.359
What are you talkin' about?
You know it was an accident.

12:50.361 --> 12:52.995
Yeah, but let's just say,
public opinion has shifted.

12:52.997 --> 12:55.598
And the boys upstairs said
they can no longer ignore it.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.567
Who the hell are
the "boys upstairs?"

12:57.569 --> 12:59.368
I have no idea.
There's no elevator.

12:59.370 --> 13:00.670
But whoever they are,

13:00.672 --> 13:02.572
they're pretty steamed
about this whole thing.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.174
Peter, what-what's
going on?

13:05.176 --> 13:06.776
They're taking me to jail!

13:06.778 --> 13:07.944
Oh, my God!

13:07.946 --> 13:09.278
Don't worry, Dad!

13:09.280 --> 13:12.081
I'll send you a cake
with a file in it!

13:13.518 --> 13:16.385
These are just the owner manuals
for all our kitchen appliances.

13:16.387 --> 13:18.121
Well, guess I finally have time

13:18.123 --> 13:20.757
to learn to reset the clock
on the coffee maker.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.192
MORGAN FREEMAN:
<i>He never did.</i>

13:31.236 --> 13:32.969
You're-you're, uh...

13:32.971 --> 13:34.704
you're not gonna
rape me, are you?

13:34.706 --> 13:36.439
Of course I'm not
gonna rape you.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.775
I'm gonna make you
fall in love with me.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.043
Then... we'll
see what happens.

13:41.045 --> 13:44.647
Oh, no.
It's already working.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.816
Griffin, you have a visitor.

13:46.818 --> 13:48.818
Carter? What are
you doing here?

13:48.820 --> 13:50.119
Hello, Griffin.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.255
I'd like to talk to you
about these charges

13:52.257 --> 13:53.656
that have been
brought against you.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.658
Why don't we go somewhere
a little more private?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.795
I, uh, guess I'll see you
in a little bit?

13:58.797 --> 14:00.897
It's gonna feel
like an eternity.

14:00.899 --> 14:04.700
How is it that I'm only
just now meeting you?

14:06.671 --> 14:08.337
Look, Carter, you
got to believe me.

14:08.339 --> 14:10.907
I didn't shoot Cleveland
Junior because he was black!

14:10.909 --> 14:12.809
Hey, you don't have
to tell me that.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.511
But the media's out there
making you look like a monster,

14:15.513 --> 14:18.414
all for exercising
your constitutional rights.

14:18.416 --> 14:19.749
Grover's a monster.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.918
But don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of this.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.586
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit back

14:23.588 --> 14:25.655
and let them do this
to one of my own.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.690
What, you mean
your family?
Huh?

14:27.692 --> 14:29.258
Oh, yeah, yeah, that.
Yeah, right.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.027
Look, I'm gonna
bail you out of here,

14:31.029 --> 14:33.596
set you up with my lawyer,
and get these charges dropped.

14:33.598 --> 14:34.864
Well, how you gonna do that?

14:34.866 --> 14:36.599
Don't worry.
I'll come up with a good story,

14:36.601 --> 14:37.834
and they'll eat it up.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.036
Not like when I read
my<i> JAG</i> fan fiction

14:40.038 --> 14:42.638
at the<i> NCIS</i> convention.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.173
"JAG stood up and yelled,

14:44.175 --> 14:46.542
"'Objection, Your Honor,
by Navy law.'

14:46.544 --> 14:48.477
"He then turned
to the lady lawyer,

14:48.479 --> 14:50.546
"the gal from the October<i> Maxim,</i>

14:50.548 --> 14:51.948
"who still managed to be hot

14:51.950 --> 14:54.517
"despite her sexless,
pageboy haircut.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.185
Or perhaps because of it."

14:56.187 --> 14:57.653
Boo!
Terrible!

14:57.655 --> 15:00.957
Right branch of the military,
wrong investigative arm!

15:02.961 --> 15:05.561
(loud crowd chatter)

15:05.563 --> 15:08.564
And I was trying to
get back into my house,

15:08.566 --> 15:11.968
and my neighbor,
Mr. Griffin, shot me.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.903
He said
he felt threatened by me,

15:13.905 --> 15:16.539
and that hurt even worse
than getting shot!

15:16.541 --> 15:18.140
GALLERY:
Aw!

15:18.142 --> 15:20.076
Your Honor, permission
to hug the witness?

15:20.078 --> 15:21.677
Granted.

15:21.679 --> 15:24.213
(crying)

15:24.215 --> 15:25.681
Don't worry,
Mr. Griffin.

15:25.683 --> 15:27.016
You're every bit
as sympathetic

15:27.018 --> 15:28.851
as this chubby-cheeked
cocoa angel.

15:28.853 --> 15:31.087
I haven't been listening.
What's goin' on?

15:31.089 --> 15:32.822
I don't think it's
lost on any of us

15:32.824 --> 15:34.757
that the laws are
written on white paper.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.226
Yeah, white paper.
Check your jacket pocket.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.395
"I don't think it's
lost on any of us

15:39.397 --> 15:41.264
that the laws are
written on white paper."

15:41.266 --> 15:42.732
Hey, look,
I'm just saying,

15:42.734 --> 15:45.368
it's no surprise that
justice isn't colorblind.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.103
Check your other
jacket pocket.

15:47.105 --> 15:48.537
"Hey, look, I'm just saying

15:48.539 --> 15:50.606
it's no surprise that
justice isn't colorblind."

15:50.608 --> 15:51.908
Stewie, you're a jerk!

15:51.910 --> 15:53.342
Check Chris' pocket.

15:53.344 --> 15:54.777
What? There's nothing
in here, and...

15:54.779 --> 15:57.346
Oh, God, the bottom of the
pocket's been cut out!

15:57.348 --> 15:58.614
Thanks, Brian!

15:58.616 --> 16:01.884
I was the mastermind
behind this whole thing!

16:01.886 --> 16:03.786
Your witness.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.388
All right, watch this.

16:05.390 --> 16:08.357
This is where we take control
of the situation.

16:08.359 --> 16:10.726
Mr. Brown, you testified
that you were listening to music

16:10.728 --> 16:12.128
at the time of the shooting.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.296
That's right.

16:13.298 --> 16:16.299
And isn't Jay-Z music?
Yes.

16:16.301 --> 16:19.769
And doesn't he have the lyrics,
"I put the gun to you.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.938
"I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up,

16:21.940 --> 16:24.707
put ya inside the mattress
like drug money"?

16:24.709 --> 16:26.042
(gallery gasping)

16:26.044 --> 16:29.545
I was listening
to Neil Sedaka's Hanukkah album.

16:29.547 --> 16:31.147
And isn't true
that your last name

16:31.149 --> 16:32.882
is the same
as Chris Brown's?

16:32.884 --> 16:34.817
Yes, but I don't see what--

16:34.819 --> 16:36.953
And what did Chris Brown
do to Rihanna?

16:36.955 --> 16:39.488
He hit her, like,
a hundred times.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.424
Your Honor, I'd like
to enter into evidence

16:41.426 --> 16:43.826
this photo of a
badly beaten Rihanna

16:43.828 --> 16:46.495
as well as this print ad
for the<i> Entourage</i> movie.

16:46.497 --> 16:47.496
Why?!

16:47.498 --> 16:48.931
I can't unsee this!

16:48.933 --> 16:50.166
Who is this for?!

16:50.168 --> 16:51.467
What's he doing?

16:51.469 --> 16:53.469
He's making Cleveland Jr.
look like a thug.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.837
I know.
That's the idea.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.006
You don't want to go
back to jail, do you?

17:02.246 --> 17:03.679
I don't know.

17:03.681 --> 17:05.414
Maybe.

17:05.416 --> 17:08.117
Mr. Brown, please
pick up this knife.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.752
Aah!
He's got a knife!

17:09.754 --> 17:11.120
(crowd gasping)

17:11.122 --> 17:13.189
(grunting)

17:20.264 --> 17:21.630
This isn't fair!

17:21.632 --> 17:24.033
They're making my son
look like a common hoodlum!

17:24.035 --> 17:25.501
Joe, you're a cop!

17:25.503 --> 17:26.802
Do something!

17:26.804 --> 17:28.871
No, the soap
covers everything.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.774
You might see, like, the
very top of the crack,

17:31.776 --> 17:34.610
but that's-that's
not what it's about.

17:38.483 --> 17:41.350
How do you sleep
at night?

17:41.352 --> 17:43.552
Propped up on pillows,
on account of my fat throat.

17:43.554 --> 17:45.721
If I lay flat on
my back, I die.

17:45.723 --> 17:48.290
I need pillows
between my thighs myself.

17:48.292 --> 17:50.526
And this friendship
is over!

17:52.296 --> 17:54.797
(crowd clamoring in anger)

18:00.138 --> 18:02.838
Thanks for letting me
sit in the back.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.407
I was flipping people
off the whole way.

18:04.409 --> 18:06.876
(laughs)

18:06.878 --> 18:08.911
Get out of here,
all of you!

18:08.913 --> 18:12.548
My son didn't do
anything wrong!

18:12.550 --> 18:15.551
(crowd clamoring in anger)

18:15.553 --> 18:18.854
Carter, I think this has
all kind of gone too far.

18:18.856 --> 18:19.855
What do you think
you're doing?

18:19.857 --> 18:22.158
I'm gonna make this right.

18:23.194 --> 18:24.894
Everyone!
Everyone!

18:24.896 --> 18:26.929
Listen, I have
something to say.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.698
Cleveland Jr. doesn't
deserve any of this.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.001
All those things you heard
about Cleveland Jr. were lies.

18:32.003 --> 18:34.403
He didn't do anything to me.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.672
He's a good kid,
from a good family.

18:36.674 --> 18:40.009
I just got scared,
and I did something stupid.

18:40.011 --> 18:42.278
I swear, it had nothing to do
with the color of his skin,

18:42.280 --> 18:45.514
but... I did shoot him.

18:46.851 --> 18:50.252
I deserve to be held
responsible for my actions.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.721
Even if that means
going to jail.

18:52.723 --> 18:53.889
You heard him,
other cops.

18:53.891 --> 18:55.624
Let's take him in.

18:55.626 --> 18:57.126
He doesn't know
our names, does he?

18:57.128 --> 18:58.794
I don't think he does.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.632
Wait a minute.

19:03.634 --> 19:05.634
Peter didn't shoot my son.

19:05.636 --> 19:07.236
I did.

19:07.238 --> 19:08.404
(crowd gasps)

19:08.406 --> 19:10.372
Peter was just taking
the blame for me.

19:10.374 --> 19:13.109
He's a good friend.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.445
Eh, Mr. Brown,
what exactly are you saying?

19:16.447 --> 19:18.481
I'm saying that I,
Cleveland Brown,

19:18.483 --> 19:19.949
a black man,

19:19.951 --> 19:21.584
shot Cleveland Brown, Jr.,

19:21.586 --> 19:23.886
another black man.

19:27.091 --> 19:28.657
Wait, wh-where
did everybody go?

19:28.659 --> 19:30.459
You want to make
the media go away?

19:30.461 --> 19:33.295
Just mention
black-on-black crime.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.464
Boy, the world
we live in, huh?

19:35.466 --> 19:37.833
Brian, reach into
Meg's pocket.

19:37.835 --> 19:39.268
Go ahead, Brian.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.971
I-I-I don't want to.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.173
Cleveland,
why did you do that?

19:44.175 --> 19:47.309
Peter, since this is about
racism, why don't we take

19:47.311 --> 19:51.247
a slow, hands-clasped-behind-
the-back walk together?

19:51.249 --> 19:53.349
Listen, I know you wouldn't
have shot Cleveland Jr.

19:53.351 --> 19:55.317
on account of his race.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.286
You shot him because
you're stupid.

19:57.288 --> 19:59.688
That's all
I'm trying to say!

19:59.690 --> 20:01.824
And I know you don't
have hate in your heart.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.360
You were willing to go to jail
for shooting my son.

20:04.362 --> 20:06.595
You took responsibility.

20:06.597 --> 20:08.931
That's what's important.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.300
So... you forgive me?

20:11.302 --> 20:13.469
Of course I do.

20:13.471 --> 20:16.705
Oh, thanks, Cleveland.

20:16.707 --> 20:18.507
Hey, how you
feeling there, champ?

20:18.509 --> 20:19.708
I'm good.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.210
Getting better
every day.

20:21.212 --> 20:22.711
Aw, I'm happy
to hear that.

20:22.713 --> 20:25.814
Look, I-I hope
you know I'm sorry.

20:25.816 --> 20:27.616
Hey, these things happen.

20:27.618 --> 20:29.552
That's my boy.

20:31.656 --> 20:33.389
Mr. Griffin?
Yeah?

20:33.391 --> 20:34.657
Just so you know,

20:34.659 --> 20:36.559
I'm gonna be coming
for your ass.

20:36.561 --> 20:38.194
Wh-What's that now?

20:38.196 --> 20:39.695
I'm saying it's on!

20:39.697 --> 20:41.697
You ever feel the cool steel

20:41.699 --> 20:44.733
of a switchblade
pressed against your temple?

20:45.736 --> 20:47.469
(laughs)
Hey, Mr. Griffin,

20:47.471 --> 20:48.904
I'm just kidding.

20:48.906 --> 20:50.506
Or am I?

20:50.508 --> 20:52.875
You're gonna wonder about that,
you fat bitch.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.643
See you later!

21:31.916 --> 21:33.949
