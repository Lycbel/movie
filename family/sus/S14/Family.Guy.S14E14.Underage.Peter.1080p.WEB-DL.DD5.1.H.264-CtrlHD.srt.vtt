you may as well Levi's.

You know, Brian,
hanging out with you

11:34.227 --> 11:36.528
this past week has been awesome.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.730
Yeah, why don't we,
why don't we do this anymore?

11:38.732 --> 11:41.566
We-we-we used to do fun stuff
all the time, you know?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.535

11:53.914 --> 11:55.714
I agree, buddy, I agree.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.983
All right, I'm gonna go barf
down the garbage disposal.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.853
Brian, I think
we can get John Mayer

12:01.855 --> 12:03.822
to stop tweeting again,
but we all got to work together.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.924
Oh, my God!
Are you drunk again?

12:05.926 --> 12:08.593
Yeah, I was, I was just hanging
out with my main man, Peter.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.928
"Main man"?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.529
"Hanging out"?

you to buy alcohol!

that he only started

Trust me, as soon as you're
no longer of use to him,

all my time with Peter.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.921
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right.

morbidly obese friend?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.967
And we... are in!

12:48.969 --> 12:50.301
All right, I better go.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.238
I got to go tell him
"This isn't a game, man."

12:53.240 --> 12:55.140
Brian, do you have
any idea why Peter

12:55.142 --> 12:56.741
was trying to climb
in the dishwasher?

12:56.743 --> 12:58.943
I thought it was
a Tokyo apartment.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.945
Sorry, Lois,
we, uh, we got--

13:00.947 --> 13:02.213
I guess we had
a little too much to drink.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.748
"To drink"?!

13:03.750 --> 13:05.416
It's against the law
for him to do that!

13:05.418 --> 13:06.785
Was Stewie in here?

13:06.787 --> 13:09.954
Was, was he in here?
I... I smell his cologne.

13:09.956 --> 13:10.822
Listen to me, Brian.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.590
No more booze in this house.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.759
You're gonna get us
all in trouble.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.461

maybe we should find

13:16.463 --> 13:18.129
some place else to get--
to drink.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.532
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.902
Hi, we're here
from the '80s FBI.

cut my gut!

13:44.925 --> 13:47.025
Hey, Peter,
can I ask you something?

13:47.027 --> 13:49.093
You're not just hanging out
with me because I,

13:49.095 --> 13:51.262
I can buy you alcohol, right?

13:51.264 --> 13:53.598
What?! Course not.
We're friends.

Yeah, no, I-I know. That's,
that's, that's what I thought.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.837
I know Lois gets
mad about it,

13:58.839 --> 14:01.039

to point at things.

move the bagels?

14:05.612 --> 14:08.112

This is a pointing bird.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.881
All right, I just saw
a sprinkler come on,

14:09.883 --> 14:11.950

tell me who that is

16:11.004 --> 16:13.171
Just shut up, Peter.
I'm done with you, all right?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.173
You completely lied about why
you were hanging out with me.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.441
What?
I never lie.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.343
Well, except for
that one time.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.811
Oh, my God!

16:19.813 --> 16:21.846
My husband's having
a heart attack!

16:21.848 --> 16:23.848
Is anyone here a doctor?!

16:23.850 --> 16:25.984
I have a 13-inch penis!

16:25.986 --> 16:28.152
(applause)

16:28.154 --> 16:29.520
And besides,
I'm sick of you

16:29.522 --> 16:30.788
acting like you're
such a victim.

16:30.790 --> 16:31.990
You agreed to buy us booze,

16:31.992 --> 16:33.157
'cause we weren't old enough.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.425
You're not old enough?!

16:34.427 --> 16:36.160
You're a man
in his 40s!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.029
This whole law
is ridiculous!

16:38.031 --> 16:39.664
Hey, can one of you guys
with elbows

16:39.666 --> 16:42.033
try to get
this truck to honk?

16:42.035 --> 16:44.035
(truck horn honks twice)

16:44.037 --> 16:45.803
Ah, that and giving noogies

16:45.805 --> 16:48.840
is what I miss most
about having elbows.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.042
You know, Brian,
what you said is right.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.610
This law is stupid.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.112
I mean, if it
weren't for that,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.380
we never would've
been in this fight.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.015
Yeah, but what difference
does it make?

16:57.017 --> 16:59.150
It's the law.
Nothing we can do about it.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.284
The hell there's not.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.786
I bet if we worked together

17:01.788 --> 17:03.221
we could find a way
to change it back.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.189
I... I don't know, Peter.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.692
Come on, I know it seems hard,
but we can't just give up.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.028
I mean, what if Thomas
Edison had given up?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.195
Uh, what's that?

17:11.197 --> 17:12.196
What's that thing
you're working on?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.498
Well, it's
a lightbulb and...

17:13.500 --> 17:14.999

17:20.240 --> 17:22.240
It lights up a room

17:22.242 --> 17:24.308
Lights up a room using
electrical stuff!

17:24.310 --> 17:28.012
I was about to say that,
because<i> I</i> invented it!

17:28.014 --> 17:29.247
Uh, what are
you working on?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.249
It's a phonograph...
Phonograph!

Okay, Peter, I know how
we can get the law changed.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.731
I've been doing some research,
and it says here

17:46.733 --> 17:49.500
that in eight months, we can
get a non-binding proposition

17:49.502 --> 17:52.270

A cowboy and a princess?

18:17.063 --> 18:20.131
Uh, yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Mayor.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.101
Oh, a Western princess!

18:23.103 --> 18:25.236
All right, listen, we want
that drinking law gone.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.206
And everybody knows the best way
to get any law struck down

18:28.208 --> 18:30.108
is to get the gays
angry about it.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.776
Bruce?
Jeffrey?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.111

Mr. Mayor!

You said you was 39!

18:39.285 --> 18:41.085
I was just trying
to get you in bed.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.721
I thought we'd both
be dead by now.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.157
Crap. But come on, you got
to change that law!

18:46.159 --> 18:47.892
I mean, it's already
ruined a friendship

18:47.894 --> 18:49.927
with one of the best guys
I know!

18:49.929 --> 18:51.729
CAROL:
Adam, who's at the door?

18:51.731 --> 18:52.964
Oh, hi, Brian.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.132
Hi, Peter.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.666
Wait a minute.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.102
Is that, is that wine?

18:58.104 --> 19:01.172
Yeah, Adam just poured me
a little before dinner.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.306
Wow, you guys eat late.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.341
No, Peter,
don't you see?

19:03.343 --> 19:05.109
Carol's underage, too!

19:05.111 --> 19:07.245
The mayor just broke
his own law!

19:08.181 --> 19:09.580
Mm, that's a good point.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.749
I guess I'll just have
to resign in scandal

19:11.751 --> 19:13.751
while leaving the law intact.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.787
Or you could
just change the law.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.322
But it's a good law.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.590
No, it ain't!

19:19.592 --> 19:20.758
Look, don't you understand
what drinking

19:20.760 --> 19:22.326
means to us working stiffs?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.328
It helps us forget about our day

19:24.330 --> 19:26.497
and tell our children we
love 'em with a straight face.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.368
It allows gross uggos to boof
each other's gross uggo parts.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.703
And it gives people the courage
to sneak onto their mayor's

19:32.705 --> 19:36.207
property and blackmail him
and eat all his ripe tomatoes.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.209
That was a croquet ball.

19:38.211 --> 19:41.512
Ah, then could you point me to
the closest nighttime dentist?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.382
So listen, Mr. Mayor,
what do you say about that law?

19:44.384 --> 19:46.784
(sighs)
All right, I'll repeal it.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.453
But only if you send me and
Carol a copy of that picture.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.323
We don't have a lot
of the two of us together.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.959
Brian, we did it!
We got him to change the law!

19:54.961 --> 19:57.328
Just goes to show, if anybody
wants a law changed,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.830
they should just go
to their mayor's house.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.233
Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate

20:02.235 --> 20:04.035
what you said there,
about our friendship.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.536
Well, to be honest, Brian,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.338
at first I did just want you
to buy us beer.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.974
But then the-the more
we were hanging out,

20:09.976 --> 20:12.210
I-I remembered how much fun
we used to have together.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.045
I guess after all these years,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.214
I started taking you
for granted.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.649
But you're still my best friend.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.818
Even if I don't
always act like it.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.486
I enjoyed hanging out
with you, too.
