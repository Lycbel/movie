WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:06.071
(groaning softly)

00:11.645 --> 00:14.046
Okay, who'd like to start
us off with show-and-tell?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.814
Stewie?

00:15.816 --> 00:18.817
Yes, today I brought in
my mother's driver's license.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.787
Now, if you look closely,
she's clearly drunk.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.489
You could put a Breathalyzer up
to that photo,

00:23.491 --> 00:25.190
and she'd get a DUI.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.393
Ha-ha, Stewie's naked!

00:27.395 --> 00:29.028
What?!

00:29.030 --> 00:30.996
(laughter)

00:30.998 --> 00:32.297
Oh, my God!
Don't look! Don't look!

00:32.299 --> 00:34.033
Cell phones down!
Cell phones down!

00:34.035 --> 00:36.468
(ominous music playing)

00:40.307 --> 00:43.242
(shouts)
What the deuce?!
Stewie!

00:43.244 --> 00:44.843
Run from the monster.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.079
You might have to drive.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.082
(groaning)

00:52.253 --> 00:55.020
Thank you all so much
for coming this evening

00:55.022 --> 00:57.389
to my very fancy dinner party.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.225
Oh, my God!
I'm at Glenn Close's house!

01:00.227 --> 01:02.394
You look very handsome tonight,
Stewie.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.229
Well, thank you.
And you're the prettiest

01:04.231 --> 01:06.665
of all the women I know
whose name is Glenn.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.667
Everyone,
please finish your salads,

01:08.669 --> 01:10.936
because our main course tonight
is...

01:10.938 --> 01:13.739
boiled rabbit.
(laughing)

01:13.741 --> 01:15.107
(laughter)

01:15.109 --> 01:17.276
I-I don't... I don't get that.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.411
It seems weird that I'd have
a joke in my own dream

01:19.413 --> 01:21.346
that I don't get.
Oh, thank you so...

01:21.348 --> 01:22.414
(shouts)

01:24.752 --> 01:26.819
(groaning)

01:29.557 --> 01:31.290
Quick, you're
almost on!

01:31.292 --> 01:32.291
What? I'm on?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.359
But I don't know any

Lois, get in here!

02:27.148 --> 02:29.014
It's dark and I'm frightened!

02:32.153 --> 02:34.219
I think they've got this thing
backwards.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.289
Hey, wake up!

02:37.291 --> 02:40.526
I had a bad dream, so now
your night has to be terrible.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.127
Peter, Stewie's upset.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.129
Scooch over so he
can sleep with us.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.831
Oh, come on.
Are you serious?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.432
Last time, he kicked me
all night.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.202
And I got a big day tomorrow.
I got two shows.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.204
All right, folks,
big treat for you today.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.972
He's a little shy.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.542
Put your hands together
for Sham-Peter!

02:56.544 --> 02:59.545
I'm not shy! I'm angry!

02:59.547 --> 03:02.214
I'm in constant pain!

03:02.216 --> 03:05.450
This act has been condemned
by over 30 nations!

03:05.452 --> 03:08.387
I'm gonna kill you all!

03:12.159 --> 03:14.159
PETER:<i> Ah, crap.</i>
<i>I can't sleep like this.</i>

03:14.161 --> 03:15.727
<i>And now my mind is racin'.</i>

03:15.729 --> 03:18.030
<i>Like, how does that candle</i>

03:18.032 --> 03:20.299

<i>I mean, the teapot I get,</i>

03:20.301 --> 03:22.734
<i>'cause she's a girl. But</i>

03:22.736 --> 03:24.336

03:24.338 --> 03:25.571
(coughs)

03:25.573 --> 03:27.072
(groans)

03:29.543 --> 03:31.076
Couch it is, I guess.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.811
Oh, my God. The couch is gone.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.246
Where the hell is...
Oh, that's right.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.348
Couchella is this weekend.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.016
(electronic music playing)

03:38.018 --> 03:40.219
Hey, man,
where you been?!

03:40.221 --> 03:43.222
I just had sex with
a girl on her period!

03:43.224 --> 03:45.724
Dude, that's not a brag!

03:50.397 --> 03:52.397
So, how fat are you?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.766
240? Nice.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.768
Oh, Peter! What are
you doing down here?

03:56.770 --> 03:59.404
Oh, hey, Brian. Stewie
kind of took over our bed,

03:59.406 --> 04:00.839
so I'm looking
for a place to sleep.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.274
Well, why don't you
go up to the attic?

04:02.276 --> 04:03.842
I think there's even
a futon up there.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.277
Huh. That's a great idea.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.112
Geez, I'm glad you came along.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.048
I'm gonna sleep better
than a cartoon sheriff.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.117
(snoring)

04:14.388 --> 04:16.855
(click)

04:16.857 --> 04:19.291
(twinkly toes sound effect)

04:19.293 --> 04:22.461
(quietly): I was in jail 'cause
I killed a bunch of old ladies.

04:22.463 --> 04:25.430
And now that I'm out,
I'm gonna do it again.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.266
(light-hearted music cue)

04:33.274 --> 04:35.440
Wow, Stewie,
you look exhausted.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.443
Yeah, 'cause I was up super late
last night, beefing your mom.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.746
My mom's dead.
Yeah, 'cause I
beefed her to death.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.548
Whoa, what's your problem?
Why are you being such a jerk?

04:43.550 --> 04:46.118
I'm sorry, Brian.
I had the absolute worst night.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.388
I had a weird dream.
A frightening dream.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.756
Yeah, Stewie,
that's called a nightmare.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.758
Sounds like you must've had
your first one.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.459
That's what
a nightmare is?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.428
I thought "nightmare" meant,
like, being invited

04:56.430 --> 04:57.929
to an apartment party.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.765
Get a house if you
want to have a party.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.333
I'm not going to a
party in an apartment.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.567
Relax, it's no big deal.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.303
People have nightmares
all the time.

05:04.305 --> 05:07.105
Oh, no, Brian. I am not living
through that horror again.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.474
In fact, I've decided
that from this day forward,

05:09.476 --> 05:12.477
I shall never allow myself
to fall asleep again.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.478
Come on, that's ridiculous.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.479
How do you think
you're gonna do that?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.114
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get a job

05:16.116 --> 05:18.450
working the night
shift at a supermarket.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.285
Hey, where's
the vegetable aisle?

05:20.287 --> 05:23.355
Yeah, right, it's 2:00 a.m.
You're not here for vegetables.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.525
(dejectedly):
Well, I got the
12 cucumbers.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.360
What's wrong?
Just this guy at the...

05:28.362 --> 05:30.262
(sighs)
Never mind.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.600
Peter, we have a hamper.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.503
Stop throwing your dirty clothes
in the toilet.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.705
Peter?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.540
Peter, where are you?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.408
(video game sound effects)

05:44.712 --> 05:46.712
What's all this?

05:46.714 --> 05:49.314
Oh, hey, Lois.
Welcome to the Pete Pad,

05:49.316 --> 05:52.184
where the dancing's hot,
the drinks are hot...

05:52.186 --> 05:53.618
Everything's
just freakin' hot.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.487
What have you
done to the attic?

05:55.489 --> 05:56.788
Well, when I slept up here
the other night,

05:56.790 --> 05:58.557
I realized
what a great space it is.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.326
So I dragged up some stuff and
turned it into a sweet hangout.

06:01.328 --> 06:04.496
Even made it extra awesome
by stealing a real street sign.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.031
(children giggling in distance)

06:06.033 --> 06:08.233
(tires screech, thudding)
(children scream)

06:08.235 --> 06:10.369
I don't understand. What
are you gonna do up here?

06:10.371 --> 06:12.237
Eh, mostly just burn the roof
of my mouth

06:12.239 --> 06:14.406
on unevenly-heated
microwave burritos.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.442
Now I'm busy, so close the floor
and get out of here.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.850
All right, all right,
come on, Stewie.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.985
You've got to stay awake.
I know what'll help.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.387
I'll watch that preview channel

06:28.389 --> 06:30.589
that always has
inconsistent volumes.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.492
ANNOUNCER:
<i>They're mother and daughter</i>
<i>but also best friends.</i>

06:33.494 --> 06:36.395
<i>Catch</i> Gilmore Girls
<i>on Channel 367.</i>

06:36.397 --> 06:39.331
ANNOUNCER 2 (loudly, blown-out):
<i>You can name your own price</i>
<i>for hotel rooms!</i>

06:49.176 --> 06:51.743
(water gurgling)

06:53.614 --> 06:55.580
(exhales)
Help! Please!

06:56.583 --> 06:59.851
(grunts)
Damn it! Why can't I move?!

07:00.788 --> 07:02.220
(rattling)

07:02.222 --> 07:05.190
(growling)

07:05.192 --> 07:06.525
Aah!

07:06.527 --> 07:08.026
Stewie, you okay?
What happened?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.628
I was just sitting here
on the couch and I had

07:09.630 --> 07:11.530
another nightmare
about that horrible monster.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.764
Okay, that's it.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.966
I'm gonna help you get these
nightmares under control.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.868
Really?
Oh, thank you, Brian.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.538
And maybe I can help you
control your strange obsession

07:19.540 --> 07:20.806
with eating
pencil erasers.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.275
It's not an obsession.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.709
Mmm, mmm, oh, yeah.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.611
Oh, so rubbery. Mmm.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.580
It's like a little
steak. Mmm, mmm.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.915
Brian, you really should...

07:29.917 --> 07:32.117
The world is small and
safe when I do this!

07:38.625 --> 07:41.993
Okay, Stewie, I read the review
of a dream book on Amazon,

07:41.995 --> 07:43.562
so I think I can help you.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.665
Literally every other tab
is open to Lusty Matures.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.433
Yup, that's what
it takes now.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.335
Anyway, it says here
that most nightmares

07:50.337 --> 07:52.270
are born of
subconscious fears.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.905
So maybe if we make
a list of the things

07:53.907 --> 07:56.074
you're most afraid of,
we can face and conquer

07:56.076 --> 07:57.909
these fears together, and
then your nightmares'll end.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.111
Huh, that's actually
a good idea.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.347
Like the U.S. Army Reserves.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.682
(explosion)

08:03.684 --> 08:06.585
We're completely surrounded.
We need reinforcements.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.620
You know who could
really bail us out?

08:08.622 --> 08:12.657
Somebody who works five days
a week at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.030
These new digs of yours
are pretty great, Peter.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.500
Hey, I brought
construction paper and markers

08:21.502 --> 08:23.502
in case you guys
want to draw breasts.

08:23.504 --> 08:27.172
Cool. But before that, who's up
for another insulation fight?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.940
I'm in.
Heck yeah.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.309
(giggling)

08:31.311 --> 08:32.844
Ha!
(giggling)

08:32.846 --> 08:34.913
Gotcha!

08:37.351 --> 08:38.617
Missed me.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.485
Sneak attack!

08:40.487 --> 08:42.554
(all giggling)

08:43.524 --> 08:45.590
(coughing)

08:46.793 --> 08:48.560
What are you
doing up here?

08:48.562 --> 08:50.529
I need you to take
the trash out.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.563
You know what?
I'm gonna use this

08:51.565 --> 08:54.065
Peter Doesn't Have to Take Out
the Trash coupon

08:54.067 --> 08:55.300
that I got for my anniversary.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.902
You gave that to yourself.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.870
I don't know,
it says "official."

08:58.872 --> 09:00.739
Oh, forget it,
I'll do it myself.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.742
This whole attic
business is ridiculous.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.744
Hey, guys, check it out.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.579
I'm a lady.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.014
Joe...

09:09.016 --> 09:11.650
you hit a home run with
that, I want to try it.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.722
All right, Stewie,
time to tackle your fears.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.925
Now, it sounds like
you're scared of monsters.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.561
So to help you get over it,
here's Frankenstein.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.564
(growls)
I'm Frankenstein.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.198
I'm actually really nice.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.235
There's no need
to be scared of me. (growls)

09:30.237 --> 09:31.570
Seriously?

09:31.572 --> 09:33.572
This is obviously
Chris in a costume.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.440
Huh. Well, that
can't be possible.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.043
Because here comes Chris
walking in the door right now.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.779
Hey, hey, hey.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.644
You did it on the ferry
to Block Island!

19:39.646 --> 19:41.212
QUAGMIRE:
Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke!

19:41.214 --> 19:43.381
PETER:
That's good! Puke on the dress!
Puke on the dress!

19:43.383 --> 19:44.916
Aah, damn it!

19:46.953 --> 19:49.453
MAN (over headphones):
Not all snake bites are lethal.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.622
(grunts)

19:51.624 --> 19:53.191
(all yelling)

19:53.193 --> 19:54.525
There! You happy?!

19:54.527 --> 19:57.061
You were too late.
We pooed on the gown.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.230
Ripped a big hole
in your ceiling, too.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.398
I barfed on Peter's ass.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.567
I-I don't know if it got
on the dress or not, Lois,

20:02.569 --> 20:04.235
but I-I am... I am so sorry.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.837
Yeah, this was all
a huge disaster.

20:06.839 --> 20:11.309
Let's just agree that we both
went a bit too far, hmm?

20:11.311 --> 20:13.377
I, uh... I might...

20:13.379 --> 20:16.280
I might need two weeks off
from this friendship.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.257
Stewie, you awake?

20:26.259 --> 20:27.992
Did you have any nightmares?

20:27.994 --> 20:29.427
I don't think so.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.995
(gasps)
Did you get rid of the monster?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.231
Sure did. Turned out
that monster was nothing more

20:33.233 --> 20:34.599
than a manifestation

20:34.601 --> 20:37.235
of your subconscious desire
not to disappoint me.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.270
Apparently, I'm like
a father figure to you.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.440
Okay. Wow. Somebody's
got a big head.

20:42.442 --> 20:46.043
Stewie, I want you to know...
I'm very proud of you.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.278
All right, that's...
that's awkward.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.447
How-how am I supposed
to respond to that?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.449
You are a good person.
Stop complimenting me.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.385
"Oh, I sure hope the dog
approves of who I am."

20:54.387 --> 20:56.454
I'm out of here, weirdo.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.157
There's a wedding dress out here
covered in (bleep).

21:33.092 --> 21:35.126
