10:02.903 --> 10:04.536
God, I love this time of year.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.938
It's just past
all the amazing colors of fall,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.773
and before the white of winter.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.742
Just brown and gray.

10:10.744 --> 10:11.943
Magical.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.545
All right, let's do this.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.946
All right, listen up,
I'm the captain.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.115
The teams are chosen by
a lottery system where...

10:17.117 --> 10:19.050
Aunt Karen, can I
be on your team?

10:19.052 --> 10:19.985
Yeah, yeah, me, too!

10:19.987 --> 10:21.987
Uh, yeah, sure,
I'll take, uh,

10:21.989 --> 10:24.956
Meg, Skinny,
Hot Chocolate and The Bus.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.491
Pee Pee, you get
the crumbs.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.726
Let's go.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.094
All right, let's do it, Pop!

10:29.096 --> 10:31.429
I'm gonna make some
sports points for you!

10:31.431 --> 10:32.697
We'll kick off.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.501
Hey, time-out!

10:36.503 --> 10:37.969
Did anyone tape the parade?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.071
Please tell me
someone taped the parade!

10:40.073 --> 10:41.940
(grunts)

10:41.942 --> 10:42.941
(sighs)

10:42.943 --> 10:45.443
(groaning)

10:45.445 --> 10:48.146
Oh, my God! She's
doing The Toxic Shock!

10:48.148 --> 10:50.215
(groaning)

10:53.687 --> 10:57.155
(gasping, wheezing)

10:57.157 --> 11:02.193
Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen!

11:02.195 --> 11:03.795
What the hell was that?

11:03.797 --> 11:04.996
That's his stutter.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.766
And whenever he stutters,
he usually pees his pants.

11:07.768 --> 11:11.036
N-No, I... d-d-don't.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.539
(groans):
Oh.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.976
So this is football.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.411
I like it.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.719
Hi, Dad.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.121
Look, I-I just want you to know,
I feel bad about what happened

11:30.123 --> 11:31.990
with you and Aunt Karen
the other day.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.726
Oh, you mean when she put me in
that no-bottom James Bond chair

11:34.728 --> 11:36.061
and assaulted my grundle?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.629
I didn't even
know about that.

11:37.631 --> 11:40.165
Well, that's 'cause
it didn't happen.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.200
I'd kick her ass if she
tried something like that!

11:42.202 --> 11:45.370
Dad, stop. Even I can see
that your sister's a huge bully.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.473
And trust me, I know more about
getting bullied than anyone.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.809
You do? How?

11:50.811 --> 11:54.646
♪ Celebrate good times,
come on ♪

11:54.648 --> 11:56.648
♪ Let's celebrate ♪

11:56.650 --> 11:58.183
♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ♪

11:58.185 --> 12:02.754
♪ Celebrate good times,
come on. ♪

12:04.091 --> 12:06.191
Man, I love that song.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.326
Dad, what I'm trying
to tell you is,

12:08.328 --> 12:11.029
I now see why you've been
so tough on me all these years.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.263
'Cause it makes
my friends laugh?

12:12.265 --> 12:14.699
No, because that's how
Aunt Karen treated you

12:14.701 --> 12:15.900
when you were a kid.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.368
(gasps loudly)

12:17.370 --> 12:20.071
That's right. And that's why
you need to confront Karen.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.173
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, I can't do that.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.875
I tried for years
to stand up to her.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.909
Nothing ever worked.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.277
What, so now
you're gonna quit?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.278
You can't quit.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.347
What if Muhammad Ali had quit?

12:29.349 --> 12:31.349
Ah, my grandchildren!

12:31.351 --> 12:33.184
Who would like me
to read them a book,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.553
or maybe paint their name
on a grain of rice?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.455
Honey, dinnertime!

12:37.457 --> 12:38.857
Ah, my favorite.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.558
Hot soup.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.193
Right in there.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.629
Dad, I know you can
stand up to Aunt Karen.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.966
And maybe if you finally do,
she'll stop terrorizing you,

12:47.968 --> 12:49.968
and you won't have to
take it out on me

12:49.970 --> 12:51.069
for the rest of my life.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.871
You know what, Meg?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.939
You're right!
I'm gonna do it!

12:54.941 --> 12:55.940
You are?

12:55.942 --> 12:56.941
Damn right!

12:56.943 --> 12:58.243
Yay, Dad!

12:58.245 --> 13:00.211
I am gonna become
a lady wrestler

13:00.213 --> 13:02.480
and defeat Heavy Flo
in the ring.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.215
Wait. What?! No! What?!

13:04.217 --> 13:05.483
I meant go talk to her.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.418
Nope, it's got to be a
lady wrestling match.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.254
Hey, Meg,
Thanksgiving's over.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.090
Come help me
with the Christmas decorations.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.958
Meg! Help me with
the Christmas decorations!

13:22.302 --> 13:24.269
Comments? Questions?

13:24.271 --> 13:25.236
What the hell are you...

13:25.238 --> 13:26.938
I'm sorry. Chris had
his hand up first.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.939
Chris?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.741
What's the capital
of Maryland?

13:29.743 --> 13:31.743
I do not know, but that's
a very good question.

13:31.745 --> 13:32.744
Now, Lois?

13:32.746 --> 13:34.913
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.414
First, it's not Peter.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.284
When I am in this outfit,
I am Maxi Paddy,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.519
the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.454
Peter, you look--
okay, that's clever--

13:43.456 --> 13:45.123
but, Peter,
you look ridiculous.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.257
Take that off.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.259
If you want to settle things
with your sister,

13:48.261 --> 13:49.427
just go talk to her.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.096
No, Lois, the only way to
settle a family dispute

13:52.098 --> 13:53.198
is in the cage.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.365
I mean, you don't understand.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.667
Karen made me feel worse than

13:55.669 --> 13:58.102
a guy getting cut
from a baseball team.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.170
You wanted to
see me, Coach?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.439
I'm sorry, Kyle.
You can't do this boring,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.374
stupid thing with us.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.514
All right, Peter,
your sister's the real deal.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.217
So I arranged for you
to get some combat pointers

14:12.219 --> 14:15.053
from my old buddy,
Steven Seagal.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.956
Uh, this... this fat guy?

14:17.958 --> 14:20.191
Yup. Go on, ask him anything.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.993
How... how did...?

14:21.995 --> 14:23.628
Uh, why-why you so fat?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.231
Okay, ask him about
anything but his weight.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.332
(sighs):
Uh...

14:27.334 --> 14:30.168
uh, you act Asian,
you look Native American,

14:30.170 --> 14:32.303
your name is possibly Jewish.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.671
What are you?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.206
He fat.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.877
All right, Peter,
most professional wrestlers

14:38.879 --> 14:41.212
become addicted to painkillers
at some point.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.514
So I figure,
why don't we just start now?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.351
Uh... okay,
yeah, I'm in.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.685
Where you getting
all these?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.187
Stepdaughter's purse.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.422
Ain't my problem.

14:51.424 --> 14:56.194
Man, I love putting my hand down
my pants when I'm on drugs.

14:56.196 --> 15:00.431
We should just go live on a
boat in some guy's backyard.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.767
So, you gonna do
that wrestling stuff?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.702
Nah, I'm gonna
stick with these.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.472
I would crime
for more of these.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.242
Okay, now if you're gonna defeat
your sister in the ring,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.077
you got to get to the root
of your fears.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.913
We got to go back
to your childhood,

15:14.915 --> 15:16.614
so I'm gonna
hypnotize you.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.917
Okay, go back.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.419
Now, we need to go
back in time.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.124
(high-pitched voice):
My jeans are husky.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.293
Okay, further. Further.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.861
Little further.

15:29.863 --> 15:32.297
Now, open your eyes
and tell me what you see.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.967
(demonic voice): I see the six
stations of the Lord's order,

15:35.969 --> 15:38.369
and they will all burn!

15:38.371 --> 15:39.637
Okay, too far!
Too far! Too far!

15:39.639 --> 15:41.039
Come back. Come back.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.440
Come back.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.409
(high-pitched voice): Hey,
can I make my husky jeans

15:44.411 --> 15:46.110
into cutoffs
for swimming?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.378
Ah, forget it. You're ready.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.414
Yeah, Peter.
I think you're gonna win!

15:49.416 --> 15:51.950
All right! Hey, thanks for
all your help, you guys.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.251
You know, there's
only two things

15:53.253 --> 15:54.919
I've wanted to do
my whole life:

15:54.921 --> 15:58.323
put my sister in her place

16:51.978 --> 16:54.712
And we've got quite a match
tonight between Heavy Flo

16:54.714 --> 16:56.314
and another woman
whose name I've forgotten

16:56.316 --> 16:58.116
but I'm sure is a gross pun.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.384
Right you are, Bill.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.353
Tonight, she's up against
Her Vajesty's Secret Cervix.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.689
Interesting fact:
these two gals have

17:04.691 --> 17:07.325
over eight meters of
ass crack between them.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.993
One! Two! Three!

17:08.995 --> 17:10.061
(crowd cheering)

17:10.063 --> 17:11.362
It's over!

17:11.364 --> 17:17.068
And once again, a Heavy Flo has
ruined another lady's evening!

17:17.070 --> 17:18.469
(cheering continues)

17:18.471 --> 17:20.805
PETER:
You ain't no champ!

17:20.807 --> 17:23.041
Not till you go through me!

17:23.043 --> 17:24.475
Who the hell are you?!

17:24.477 --> 17:27.845
I'm Maxi Paddy, which is
short for Maxine Patricia.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.348
I was named after my father,
Maxwell Patrick.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.416
But that's enough about me.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.418
I'm here to kick your ass!

17:33.420 --> 17:34.485
Get out of here!

17:34.487 --> 17:37.088
I'm not fighting some fat loser
from the crowd.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.091
Huh. It looks like
this Heavy Flo is pee,

17:40.093 --> 17:42.160
because you're yellow!

17:42.162 --> 17:43.494
CROWD:
Oh!

17:43.496 --> 17:44.595
Well, that didn't
quite track,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.564
but the crowd
seems to be on board.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.598
It sure does!

17:47.600 --> 17:50.034
Looks like Heavy Flo
has a challenger!

17:50.036 --> 17:52.370
All right, get up here,
but make it quick.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.872
I got a<i> Lampoon</i>
reunion to get to.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.574
Heavy Flo, always
finding a way

17:56.576 --> 17:58.943
to drop her Harvard degree
into conversation.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.878
Yes, very
off-putting, Bill.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.748
Those of us who went to Harvard
really don't appreciate it.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.549
(bell dings)

18:04.551 --> 18:06.617
(grunting)

18:09.889 --> 18:11.556
Ow! Damn it, Karen!

18:11.558 --> 18:12.423
Karen?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.758
Peter, is that you?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.093
What are you doing here?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.728
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.565
I'm tired of you bullying me!
You're going down!

18:20.567 --> 18:21.766
VENDOR:
Butt-scratcher?!

18:21.768 --> 18:23.134
Butt-scratcher!

18:23.136 --> 18:25.002
♪ ♪
(grunting)

18:50.063 --> 18:53.064
D-D-D-Don't, K-K-Karen!

18:53.066 --> 18:55.800
CROWD (chanting):
Toxic Shock! Toxic Shock!

18:57.804 --> 19:00.171
Oh, my God,
she's taking it too far!

19:00.173 --> 19:02.640
Heavy Flo is gonna break
this girl's arms!

19:02.642 --> 19:03.508
Woman's arms.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.909
Come on, Bill.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.944
N-N-No!

19:06.946 --> 19:09.080
Tell... Stewie...

19:09.082 --> 19:11.482
he's in charge of the show now.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.188
Say hello to Teen LaQueefa!

19:18.158 --> 19:21.159
One! Two! Three!

19:21.161 --> 19:22.493
(crowd cheering)

19:22.495 --> 19:24.729
I don't believe it!

19:24.730 --> 19:26.964
Heavy Flo is down, and
we have a new champion!

19:26.966 --> 19:29.133
I tell you, this is
one for the books,

19:29.135 --> 19:31.302
if anyone kept track
of this nonsense!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.538
Wow, you really
saved me!

19:33.540 --> 19:34.772
Thanks, stranger.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.607
Dad, it's me.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.010
(gasps) Meg?

19:39.012 --> 19:40.878
It was you who saved me?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.480
That's right, Dad.

19:42.482 --> 19:45.016
Wow, even after all the
crummy stuff I've done to you?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.185
But why?
Because you're my dad.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.687
And I couldn't stand by
and watch you get hurt.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.155
Wow. Thanks, Meg.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.157
You know, that's something
even my own mom and dad

19:53.159 --> 19:54.492
never did for me.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.527
They just stood by and
let Karen pick on me.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.197
Well, you deserve better.
We all do.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.532
You know, Meg, I'm really sorry

20:01.534 --> 20:03.568
I treated you so badly
over the years.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.504
I guess I was taking out
all the pain I felt on you.

20:06.506 --> 20:10.041
I understand.
Better than anybody.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.043
But I still love you, Dad.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.111
I love you, too, Meg.

20:18.351 --> 20:22.220
Did somebody order
a hot-ass bitch and this lady?

20:22.222 --> 20:23.554
Oh, you're alive.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.756
Sorry, I was told
I was in charge now.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.525
Well, if you die,
this is kind of

20:27.527 --> 20:30.294
the creative direction
I'm leaning toward.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.666
Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.668
You finally stood up
for yourself.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.537
So, Peter,
have you talked to Karen?

20:39.539 --> 20:42.573
I called, like, four times, but
she's not out of the coma yet.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.242
Apparently, they usually
use fake chairs,

20:44.244 --> 20:45.543
but Meg used a real one.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.178
Do they think
she's gonna survive?

20:47.180 --> 20:48.679
It could go either way.

20:48.681 --> 20:53.551
(phone ringing)
Hello? No, I think I'm a
different blood type.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.553
No, I don't
want to check.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.622
Doctor says there's
nothing they can do.
