Ugh, look at Miss Tammy.

00:36.795 --> 00:38.195
What a skank.

00:38.197 --> 00:40.530
She's free-muffin it
at a baby school.

00:40.532 --> 00:42.666
Hi, Stewie.
Mommy's here to pick you up.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.601
Why do you feel
the need to narrate

00:44.603 --> 00:45.969
every little thing you do?

00:45.971 --> 00:47.504
Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.872
You know, I've
actually been meaning

00:48.874 --> 00:50.607
to talk to you
about Stewie.

00:50.609 --> 00:52.542
I'm concerned that he might
have an attention problem.

00:52.544 --> 00:54.111
Attention problem?

00:54.113 --> 00:56.880
Yes, he's been a little
difficult to deal with,

00:56.882 --> 00:59.950
and on page two of three in the
<i>How To Be a Teacher</i> manual,

00:59.952 --> 01:01.451
it says that any child

01:01.453 --> 01:03.620
who's being difficult
should be medicated.

01:03.622 --> 01:05.555
What?! Drugging a baby?

01:05.557 --> 01:06.823
Are you sure?

01:06.825 --> 01:08.392
That sounds so serious.

01:08.394 --> 01:11.028
I'm afraid his behavior has
been an issue for a while.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.563
He's even been bothering
students during nap time.

01:13.565 --> 01:16.233
Hey, you up?

01:16.235 --> 01:19.536
Guess where
I have a crayon.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.175
So, I spend, like,
$75 on cat toys,

01:25.177 --> 01:26.810
and what does she play with?

01:26.812 --> 01:28.512
A shoelace.
That's crazy.

01:28.514 --> 01:31.014
Joe, that's been your answer
every time I tell a story.

01:31.016 --> 01:32.516
It's like
you're not even listening.

01:32.518 --> 01:33.984
Well, that's 'cause
you interrupted me

01:33.986 --> 01:35.585
when I was telling
you about Kevin

01:35.587 --> 01:37.888
trying to hang himself
with an extension cord.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.723
I know, that's crazy.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.325
Hey, y'all want to try
some of our new food?

01:42.327 --> 01:45.195
I'm trying to turn this place
into a gastropub.

01:45.197 --> 01:49.099
These are Korean tacos, 'cause
whatever the hell nowadays.

01:50.269 --> 01:52.035
Ugh! These are terrible!

01:52.037 --> 01:53.336
(laughs)

01:53.338 --> 01:55.405
Quagmire,
when it comes to tacos,

01:55.407 --> 01:57.374
I'll trust the Koreans,
thank you.

01:57.376 --> 02:00.844
You're nuts. This tastes like
Ani DiFranco after a bike ride.

02:00.846 --> 02:03.713
Geez, Quagmire, since when are
you such an expert on food?

02:03.715 --> 02:06.116
For your information,
I'm an excellent cook.

02:06.118 --> 02:07.851
(laughs):
You? A cook?

02:07.853 --> 02:10.687
Huh. What's your specialty?
No-way soufflé?

02:10.689 --> 02:12.889
(laughs) I'm sorry,
that was out of line.

02:12.891 --> 02:15.425
I<i> am</i> a good cook,
and I'll prove it to you!

02:15.427 --> 02:17.627
Saturday night, you
and all your wives are coming

02:17.629 --> 02:18.895
to my place for dinner.

02:18.897 --> 02:20.197
Fine. We'll be there.

02:20.199 --> 02:21.565
Ooh, can we make it
Sunday?

02:21.567 --> 02:23.900
Saturday, I'm giving
Javier Bardem a haircut.

02:23.902 --> 02:25.635
So, what'll it be?
Everything.

02:25.637 --> 02:27.237
What do you mean?

02:27.239 --> 02:29.906
Long in the short places,
short in the long places.

02:29.908 --> 02:32.809
It should be from both
the future and the past.

02:32.811 --> 02:36.313
Something a child
would do to a doll.

02:39.885 --> 02:42.586
Sorry, I just prefer
to do number two at home.

02:42.588 --> 02:44.121
Where were we?

02:44.123 --> 02:45.555
It's Stewie,
Dr. Hartman.

02:45.557 --> 02:47.290
He's having trouble
focusing at school.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.127
Ah, yes. So you're telling me
your baby won't sit still

02:50.129 --> 02:52.062
in a way that's convenient
for his teacher?

02:52.064 --> 02:53.497
Yes.

02:53.499 --> 02:54.965
I'd heard stories,
but never thought

02:54.967 --> 02:56.500
I'd see it
with my own eyes.

02:56.502 --> 02:58.635
Mrs. Griffin, I'm going
to write Stewie a prescription

02:58.637 --> 03:00.170
for ADHD medication.

03:00.172 --> 03:02.272
Really? Well,
I don't know.

03:02.274 --> 03:04.441
Doesn't that stuff
make you wired?

03:04.443 --> 03:06.610
Well, if you're low-energy
and lethargic, yes.

03:06.612 --> 03:08.111
But if you're high energy,

03:08.113 --> 03:10.013
it actually calms you down
and helps you focus.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.082
At least that's what I'm reading
on WebMD.

03:12.084 --> 03:14.818
Wow, there are a lot
of different kinds of medicines.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.353
There's a cat in here.

03:16.355 --> 03:18.622
Okay, I guess we
can give it a try.

03:18.624 --> 03:19.990
Here you go.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.425
Now, who's this little guy?

03:26.765 --> 03:29.799
Wow, when did you learn
to cook, Glenn?

03:29.801 --> 03:31.468
Well, as a young man, I found

03:31.470 --> 03:34.304
that a great meal was the
quickest way to a woman's heart.

03:34.306 --> 03:36.006
How romantic.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.441
I mean, how do you think NBA
players get all those chicks?

03:38.443 --> 03:40.377
They're all great cooks.
Except Kobe Bryant.

03:40.379 --> 03:42.312
His-his... his secret
is different.

03:42.314 --> 03:43.713
Quagmire, you're really good.

03:43.715 --> 03:45.382
You could probably
make money at this.

03:45.384 --> 03:47.717
Yeah, maybe you could
open a restaurant.

03:47.719 --> 03:49.619
Or maybe get a cooking show.

03:49.621 --> 03:51.321
You know,
the 11:30 cooking show

03:51.323 --> 03:53.156
on Channel Five
needs a new host.

03:53.158 --> 03:54.824
The old one burned off
his eyebrows,

03:54.826 --> 03:56.560
and was just too weird
to look at.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.128
You should do
it, Quagmire!

03:58.130 --> 03:59.996
I'll even come along
and cheer you on!

03:59.998 --> 04:01.898
You'd do that for me?
Course I would.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.801
I love cheering people on,
like when I go to NASCAR.

04:04.803 --> 04:06.536
(crowd cheering)
Go in a circle!

04:06.538 --> 04:09.973
Go in a circle!
Go in a circle!

04:09.975 --> 04:12.709
Advertise stuff!
Advertise stu...!

04:12.711 --> 04:14.911
Go in a circle!

04:19.651 --> 04:21.184
Hey, where's Stewie?

04:21.186 --> 04:23.853
Oh, he's probably
sleeping off his pills.
What?

04:23.855 --> 04:26.223
Well, the school said
he had an attention problem,

04:26.225 --> 04:27.891
so Dr. Hartman gave him
a prescription.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.759
You're giving a
one-year-old drugs?!

04:29.761 --> 04:31.228
You're doping up a baby!

04:31.230 --> 04:32.829
Peter, are you
okay with this?

04:32.831 --> 04:34.497
Will you stop talking?

04:34.499 --> 04:37.400
I'm trying to think about a girl
I saw at the gas station.

04:39.171 --> 04:41.271
Stewie?

04:41.273 --> 04:45.175
(slowly):
Welcome to Pillow-World, Bri.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.744
Let me get up and greet you.

04:48.847 --> 04:50.547
There we go.

04:50.549 --> 04:52.048
How you doing?

04:52.050 --> 04:54.217
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you're totally drugged out!

04:54.219 --> 04:55.452
You know something?

04:55.454 --> 04:57.120
I have been thinking

04:57.122 --> 05:01.625
about how everyone in this
family, Brian, does their job.

05:01.627 --> 05:04.794
And they do a pretty
good job of it.

05:09.635 --> 05:11.701
God, I'm really freaking
out over this audition.

05:11.703 --> 05:13.236
What if I blow it?

05:13.238 --> 05:15.105
Quagmire, when I agreed
to come to this,

05:15.107 --> 05:17.941
I didn't know it would require
this level of emotional support.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.309
You Glenn Quagmire?

05:19.311 --> 05:21.211
I'm Carson, the
producer of the show.

05:21.213 --> 05:22.812
Peter Griffin.
I should be at work.

05:22.814 --> 05:24.414
Okay, let's see
what you've got.

05:24.416 --> 05:25.615
I think you're gonna like this.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.051
Cedar plank salmon
with a maple glaze

05:28.053 --> 05:31.821
and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes
on a bed of mesclun greens.

05:33.258 --> 05:34.924
Hmm. Not bad.

05:34.926 --> 05:38.461
Also, the tomatoes can be eyes,
and the lettuce can be hair.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.764
Look down.
There's also a carrot.

05:40.766 --> 05:42.499
(laughs) This is great!

05:42.501 --> 05:44.934
Terrific food
<i>and</i> a hilarious sidekick?

05:44.936 --> 05:46.269
This! This
is the show!

05:46.271 --> 05:47.337
What do you mean?

05:47.339 --> 05:48.838
I'm saying
you're hired!

05:48.840 --> 05:50.774
Just as long as your
friend joins you.

05:50.776 --> 05:52.108
What do you say, Peter?

05:52.110 --> 05:54.010
I say let's do it!

05:54.012 --> 05:55.478
Whoops. Uh, uh.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.846
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

05:56.848 --> 05:59.516
What do I...
what-what do I do?

06:03.455 --> 06:06.923
I-I don't...
I don't know what to do now.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.927
That was the wrong choice,
Peter.

06:17.869 --> 06:19.436
Wow, Quagmire,
look at you!

06:19.438 --> 06:21.871
You're a real
TV chef!
I know.

06:21.873 --> 06:24.474
It might sound silly,
but being a chef is something

06:24.476 --> 06:26.009
I've always dreamed about.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.278
I always dream about my
house filling up with water.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.281
That's crazy. But anyway, thanks
for encouraging me, Peter.

06:31.283 --> 06:32.816
DIRECTOR:
All right, places!

06:32.818 --> 06:35.985
We're rolling
in three, two, one.

06:35.987 --> 06:37.821
Welcome back to
<i>Quagmire's Kitchen.</i>

06:37.823 --> 06:39.856
Now, this mince pie
is about ready to go.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.725
Just needs a pinch
of cinnamon.

06:41.727 --> 06:44.394
And while we're at it, how about
we take the cinnamon challenge?

06:44.396 --> 06:46.162
Okay, Peter, we've all seen
the Internet videos.

06:46.164 --> 06:47.397
We're not doing that.

06:47.399 --> 06:48.898
I was talking about
something else.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.867
I was talking about a
serious cooking thing.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.169
Now, the ingredients
of a mince pie are traceable

06:53.171 --> 06:54.838
to the 13th century,

06:54.840 --> 06:57.006
when returning European
crusaders brought back

06:57.008 --> 06:59.042
Middle Eastern recipes
containing meats,

06:59.044 --> 07:01.578
fruits and--
oh, boy-- spices.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.313
Right here,
I'm using cloves.

07:03.315 --> 07:05.014
(coughing)

07:05.016 --> 07:06.750
Of course, most people associate
mince pie with Christmas.

07:06.752 --> 07:08.351
(hacking)
But I'll be honest.

07:08.353 --> 07:10.420
I'm not afraid of
a summer mince pie.

07:10.422 --> 07:12.555
I remember the first time
I had mince pie.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.890
Our neighbor, Mrs. Morrin,

07:13.892 --> 07:15.658
introduced it to me
one afternoon.
Oh, God!

07:15.660 --> 07:17.160
I had house-sat for her
Aah!

07:17.162 --> 07:18.728
while she was visiting
her aunt in Vernon
Oh, God.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.996
and she wanted to thank me.

07:19.998 --> 07:22.065
And, oh, boy,
what a treat it was.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.401
You done?
Yeah.

07:24.403 --> 07:27.604
All right, best two
out of three, cinnamon.

07:35.614 --> 07:37.414
Still on those meds, huh?

07:37.416 --> 07:41.851
Uh, yeah, they, uh...
they help me to, um...

07:41.853 --> 07:43.787
uh... think.

07:43.789 --> 07:47.190
Okay, time for
an eyes-open nap.

07:48.727 --> 07:51.027
God, look what those pills
are doing to you.

07:51.029 --> 07:53.229
Putting you on that stuff
was a huge mistake.

07:53.231 --> 07:55.865
Like inviting a turtle
to a cocktail party.

07:55.867 --> 07:59.369
Hey. Ask me why they
call me a box turtle.

07:59.371 --> 08:01.704
(loud munching)

08:01.706 --> 08:04.407
See, this is how
American society treats unique,

08:04.409 --> 08:05.975
enthusiastic children.

08:05.977 --> 08:08.044
Instead of embracing
their mental gifts,

08:08.046 --> 08:09.913
their first reaction
is to shoot them up

08:09.915 --> 08:12.315
with hard-core drugs
until they're mindless sheeple.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.250
All the better
to send off to Kuwait

08:14.252 --> 08:16.653
and feed the Halliburton
oil machine, right?!

08:16.655 --> 08:18.721
(scoffs):
Bush.

08:18.723 --> 08:21.491
Yup. Takes all kinds.

08:21.493 --> 08:24.294
You know, a lot of kids
at my school take ADD pills.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.496
They say if you're lazy
and unmotivated,

08:26.498 --> 08:28.832
it makes you super energized
and productive.

08:28.834 --> 08:31.668
Rea... Really? Productive?

08:31.670 --> 08:33.837
Yeah. And college kids
take it all the time

08:33.839 --> 08:35.505
so they can focus
on their studies

08:35.507 --> 08:37.640
and drinking alcohol
with their butts.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.478
Focus, huh?

08:41.480 --> 08:42.846
Okay, well, Stewie,

08:42.848 --> 08:45.448
these babies can help
the garbage disposal focus

08:45.450 --> 08:47.350
because that's where
they're going.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.651
No need to follow me,

08:48.653 --> 08:51.254
because I just said
what I was gonna do.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.260
My God, I can't stop!

08:57.262 --> 08:59.596
The words are
just pouring out of me!

08:59.598 --> 09:02.599
I have more energy than a guy
who caught a T-shirt!

09:02.601 --> 09:04.634
(crowd cheering)

09:04.636 --> 09:06.803
My wife can wear this to sleep!

09:06.805 --> 09:10.006
My wife can wear this
to sleep!

09:14.279 --> 09:16.946
Okay, today we're putting
together duck breast medallions

09:16.948 --> 09:18.381
with a port wine reduction.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.216
And as I'm walking you
through the steps,

09:20.218 --> 09:23.186
watch your screen for
Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips:

09:23.188 --> 09:26.322
helpful hints and food factoids
to make your meal a success.

09:26.324 --> 09:27.657
Now, you're gonna want to start

09:27.659 --> 09:29.993
with a large,
self-sealing plastic bag.

09:29.995 --> 09:32.195
And in that bag,
we'll combine one large,

09:32.197 --> 09:34.297
finely-chopped garlic clove;

09:34.299 --> 09:36.966
one tablespoon of grated,
peeled fresh ginger;

09:36.968 --> 09:39.202
two teaspoons
of five-spice powder;

09:39.204 --> 09:42.505
a teaspoon of salt; and a half
teaspoon of fresh ground pepper.

09:42.507 --> 09:44.807
Then you're gonna want
to add the duck breasts,

09:44.809 --> 09:47.844
seal the bag, and refrigerate
that for at least one hour,

09:47.846 --> 09:50.880
or up to 24 hours, if you want
to prepare this ahead of time.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.316
Just make sure you remove
the bag from the refrigerator

09:53.318 --> 09:55.084
one hour before cooking.

09:55.086 --> 09:58.655
You're gonna put that in your
oven, preheated to 400 degrees.

10:00.358 --> 10:02.058
So we just spoon
on the drippings,

10:02.060 --> 10:03.860
and that'll brown
the skin nicely.

10:03.862 --> 10:08.231
If you bang these metal spoons
on everything, it's like<i> Stomp.</i>

10:08.233 --> 10:10.867
Look at me! I'm huge in 2002!

10:10.869 --> 10:12.535
Peter...

10:12.537 --> 10:15.071
Nothing like a night at the
theater that ends in a headache!

10:15.073 --> 10:16.773
Damn it, Peter,
that's it!

10:16.775 --> 10:19.208
I can't do this show with
you anymore! You're fired!

10:19.210 --> 10:20.510
What?! You can't fire me!

10:20.512 --> 10:22.178
Only Mr. Spacely can fire me.

10:22.180 --> 10:25.415
Griffin...
you're fired!

10:25.417 --> 10:28.184
(voice breaking):
Okay, that's fair.

10:28.186 --> 10:31.020
(crying)

10:32.424 --> 10:34.090
Peter, can
I come in?

10:34.092 --> 10:37.594
Hold on, let me put on
my weird old actress turban.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.029
Yes?

10:40.031 --> 10:42.432
Listen, I saw what happened,
but you should know,

10:42.434 --> 10:44.567
we at the station
would hate to lose you.

10:44.569 --> 10:46.102
You're a big hit
with the viewers.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.771
I will not work
with that man again.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.573
I'm not asking
you to. In fact,

10:50.575 --> 10:53.242
we'd like to offer you
your own cooking show.

10:53.244 --> 10:55.878
Hmm, let me consult
with my lawyer.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.314
Well, Peter, since the DUIs
happened so close together,

10:58.316 --> 11:00.249
we don't really have
much wiggle room here.

11:00.251 --> 11:03.586
I suggest you take the jail time
and just get it over with.

11:03.588 --> 11:06.723
I'll do it.
After October 13.

11:13.598 --> 11:15.098
Come on, Rupert.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.299
Wait-wait till you see this.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.901
This is really
something special.

11:18.903 --> 11:23.406
Check out how much water
is in the dehumidifier.

11:23.408 --> 11:26.009
Wow!

11:26.011 --> 11:28.344
That was all in the air.

11:28.346 --> 11:30.146
(light clattering)

11:31.583 --> 11:32.782
Brian?

11:32.784 --> 11:34.350
Is that... is that, uh...

11:34.352 --> 11:36.586
Is that, uh... you?

11:36.588 --> 11:37.987
Stewie! Rearrange.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.522
Ewiets. Rearrange.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.024
Wieest. Restore.

11:41.026 --> 11:43.192
Stewie. Hey, come see
what I've been working on.

11:44.763 --> 11:47.830
I call it
Space Shire Seven.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.432
Nice, nice.

11:49.434 --> 11:52.702
It's like, uh, it's like
a fake, uh, place you made?

11:52.704 --> 11:55.438
It's a medieval sci-fi universe,
adaptable to TV,

11:55.440 --> 11:57.140
movies, toys, games,
and mobile apps!

11:57.142 --> 11:59.175
I threw together a 2,000-page
treatment last night.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.810
And I just figured,
the hell with it,

12:00.812 --> 12:02.779
why not build a scale model
and record voices

12:02.781 --> 12:04.981
for all the characters? Watch.

12:04.983 --> 12:06.516
Well met, stranger.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.551
<i>Arasha deekaba plitcho.</i>

12:08.553 --> 12:10.520
That's a Nebulon Mage.
He speaks Ga'bi,

12:10.522 --> 12:12.388
this dumb language I wrote.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.457
It's then... illegal?

12:14.459 --> 12:16.392
What?

12:16.394 --> 12:18.695
Hello?

12:22.801 --> 12:25.001
Okay, now we add
the diced tomatoes.

12:25.003 --> 12:26.569
(thumping dance music,
applause in distance)

12:26.571 --> 12:28.004
Just gonna keep going here.

12:28.006 --> 12:29.572
I like to drizzle these
with a fig balsamic...

12:29.574 --> 12:31.007
(crowd cheers in distance)
Damn it.

12:31.009 --> 12:32.975
What the hell
is going on over there?!

12:34.512 --> 12:36.012
♪ I don't want ♪

12:36.014 --> 12:37.714

12:37.716 --> 12:39.849

that looks and tastes

12:39.851 --> 12:41.217
just like a pizza bagel.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.485
It's a pizza bagel.

12:42.487 --> 12:46.322
Now, as always,
add butter to taste.

12:46.324 --> 12:47.990

12:54.999 --> 12:56.532
What the hell
are you doing?

12:56.534 --> 12:58.534
You're just pouring
melted butter onto frozen foods.

12:58.536 --> 13:00.169
You're not a chef.

13:00.171 --> 13:02.605
Oh, really? Then why do I
already have a restaurant

13:02.607 --> 13:05.374
in Orlando's largest
indoor water park?

13:05.376 --> 13:07.944
This is an insult to anyone
who cares about cooking.

13:07.946 --> 13:10.179
Either you leave
the network or I do!

13:10.181 --> 13:12.949
Guys, guys, look, I know how
we can settle this: a cook-off.

13:12.951 --> 13:14.517
Each of you
cooks a meal

13:14.519 --> 13:17.220
using a secret ingredient,
<i>Iron Chef</i> style.

13:17.222 --> 13:19.021
Will we be allowed
to use calculators?

13:19.023 --> 13:20.256
Um, I... I don't...

13:20.258 --> 13:21.524
What?

13:21.526 --> 13:23.059
I say bring it on!

13:23.061 --> 13:24.527
Fine! A cook-off it is.

13:24.529 --> 13:26.395
See you in the
kitchen, jerk.

13:26.397 --> 13:29.365
I'll see you
in hell, loser.

13:30.568 --> 13:32.769
Bad day to carpool.
Yeah.

13:38.476 --> 13:40.209
Okay, Joe, Peter and I
are going head-to-head

13:40.211 --> 13:41.577
in that cooking
competition,

13:41.579 --> 13:43.112
and they're letting us
each use an assistant.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.580
Will you help me out?

13:44.582 --> 13:46.282
Okay, but just promise me
there's no reading.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.550
I'm not a strong reader.

13:47.552 --> 13:48.718
What?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.086
I'm not illiterate,
I'm just slow.

13:50.088 --> 13:51.788
What are you talking about?

13:51.790 --> 13:55.324
I never tried hard in school
'cause I could always run fast.

13:56.761 --> 13:59.295
So you're cool with being
my chef helper for the big show?

13:59.297 --> 14:00.763
Sure, but I got
to be honest--

14:00.765 --> 14:02.298
if it ain't a
fish with whiskers,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.100
I don't know what
to do with it.

14:04.102 --> 14:05.334

17:06.918 --> 17:09.185
mashed together a bunch
of sci-fi and fantasy clichés

quite right either.

shower for half an hour

butter.

Aw, sweet!

No. That's
Peter's specialty.

the secret ingredient

would be popcorn shrimps.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.113
Joe, check if we have shallots!

18:44.115 --> 18:45.848
Okay. I can't see
anything on the counter,

18:45.850 --> 18:47.450
but I'll do my best.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.619
Aah! Monster brains!

18:50.621 --> 18:52.455
TOM: Looks like Chef Griffin
is preparing

18:52.457 --> 18:55.357
a delicious five-course
butter feast.

18:55.359 --> 18:57.293
Son of a bitch,
I never cook with butter.

18:57.295 --> 18:59.128
Joe, grab my recipe book
and find a dish

18:59.130 --> 19:01.597
where I can substitute
olive oil with butter.

19:03.401 --> 19:04.600
Joe, come on, hurry!

19:04.602 --> 19:07.303
I told you
I'm not a strong reader!

19:11.442 --> 19:13.209
Damn it, Joe,
pull it together!

19:13.211 --> 19:15.778
Hey, Quagmire, FYI, I got to
take off in, like, ten minutes.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.546
I got a clarinet lesson.

19:17.548 --> 19:18.914
What?! Ugh.

19:18.916 --> 19:20.149
I can't do this.

19:20.151 --> 19:22.384
(sobbing)

19:24.055 --> 19:26.555
Aw, look at Quagmire.

19:26.557 --> 19:28.424
This was his dream.

19:28.426 --> 19:29.625
Time's almost up, Peter.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.494
We're gonna win!

19:33.097 --> 19:35.364
No, we're not.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.137
TOM: And in a stunning
turn of events,

19:41.139 --> 19:43.305
Chef Griffin
is eating his entire meal.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.074
He'll have nothing to serve.

19:47.445 --> 19:48.911
(buzzer sounds)

19:48.913 --> 19:51.080
(panting)

19:51.082 --> 19:52.848
Well, that's it.
If Chef Quagmire

19:52.850 --> 19:56.285
has prepared a dish of any kind,
he wins this competition.

19:56.287 --> 19:57.653
Let's see what he has.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.089
A warm packet
of tartar sauce

20:00.091 --> 20:01.991
brought in
from somewhere else.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.860
"When are you gonna use that?"
Bonnie said.

20:04.862 --> 20:06.595
We have a winner!

20:06.597 --> 20:07.830
(crowd cheering)

20:09.600 --> 20:12.501
Peter, you threw
the cook-off for me?

20:12.503 --> 20:14.003
I couldn't take
your dream away...

20:14.005 --> 20:15.137
Heart attack!

20:15.139 --> 20:16.705
...from you, buddy.
You're the...

20:16.707 --> 20:18.307
Mini stroke!
...one with the real...

20:18.309 --> 20:20.042
Heart attack!
...talent. You...

20:20.044 --> 20:21.510
Heart attack!
...deserve the show...

20:21.512 --> 20:23.179
Regular stroke!
...not me.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.514
You're a good
friend, Peter.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.217
But... I don't want
a show either.

20:28.219 --> 20:29.285
You don't?

20:29.287 --> 20:30.653
Of course not.

20:30.655 --> 20:32.288
I mean, look what
the show did to us.

20:32.290 --> 20:34.690
It destroyed the most
important friendship I have.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.991
JOE:
Thanks.

20:35.993 --> 20:37.860
You know what?
Let's end this for good.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.128
How?

20:39.130 --> 20:40.362
The same way Paula Deen

20:40.364 --> 20:42.231
got her cooking show
taken off the air.

20:42.233 --> 20:45.334
By saying the one word
you can't come back from.

20:45.336 --> 20:46.468
What?

20:46.470 --> 20:48.671
Say the word? Right now?

20:48.673 --> 20:51.006
Yeah. Together.

20:51.008 --> 20:53.242
Ready?

20:53.244 --> 20:56.845
You bet.
(both inhale)

20:56.847 --> 20:59.648
