00:35.020 --> 00:36.886
Okay, I call.
What do you got?

00:36.921 --> 00:39.489
Boom. Full house, jokers
over instruction cards.

00:39.524 --> 00:41.557
I do not enjoy
playing with you.

00:41.593 --> 00:43.393
Everything's so silly.

00:43.428 --> 00:45.428
You guys, you'll
never guess what.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.397
Randy Jackson was just
a big sea turtle

00:47.432 --> 00:49.065
in human clothes,
we heard.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.367
No, we all just booked
a vacation together

00:51.403 --> 00:53.770
to a private resort
in the Bahamas.

00:53.805 --> 00:55.371
Well, that's a lot
of my money,

00:55.407 --> 00:57.006
but I used to have
sex with you,

00:57.042 --> 00:58.341
so that's
the trade-off.

00:58.376 --> 01:00.443
Look, it's not as
expensive as it sounds.

01:00.478 --> 01:03.212
We found a great group rate
on a discount Web site.

01:03.248 --> 01:05.014
Wow, the Bahamas.

01:05.050 --> 01:08.251
I can't wait to get down there
and dip my fingers in the water.

01:08.286 --> 01:10.353
Yeah, it'll be awesome
to nail a hotel masseuse

01:10.388 --> 01:12.588
and then watch<i> Nanny</i>
<i>McPhee</i> in the room.

01:12.624 --> 01:13.823
So, when do we leave?

01:13.858 --> 01:15.758
Oh. Sorry, Glenn.

01:15.794 --> 01:17.727
The deal was
for couples only.

01:17.762 --> 01:19.662
I... I'm afraid
you can't come.

01:19.697 --> 01:21.898
All right, fine.
Since you'll all be gone,

01:21.933 --> 01:24.600
I'll just walk around my yard
naked, pee anywhere I want.

01:24.636 --> 01:25.768
I don't care.

01:31.576 --> 01:32.875
I think it's great
that Peter and Lois

01:32.911 --> 01:34.243
are getting away together.

01:34.279 --> 01:36.746
Yeah, I think Dad's actually
kind of excited about it.

01:36.781 --> 01:39.415
Yes, very. He even bought
some sort of language tapes,

01:39.451 --> 01:41.818
although I don't think
he's using them properly.

01:41.853 --> 01:43.820
I would like
to hear the specials.

01:45.890 --> 01:48.224
I would like to
hear the specials.

01:48.259 --> 01:51.494
Where is the Eiffel Tower?

01:51.529 --> 01:53.396
I would rather
hear the specials.

01:56.101 --> 01:57.433
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:57.469 --> 02:00.136
I shoved an employee at Wendy's
and they called the cops.

02:00.171 --> 02:02.939
You got to warn somebody before
you hand him a square burger.

02:02.974 --> 02:05.641
Thanks again for watching the
kids while we're gone, Daddy.

02:05.677 --> 02:07.157
Yeah, but how come
Babs couldn't come?

02:07.178 --> 02:10.046
Oh, she wanted to be here, but
she got hired to be the stuffy

02:10.081 --> 02:13.916
old woman who slowly comes
around to it in a rap video.

02:13.952 --> 02:17.720

know you said this trip

02:39.644 --> 02:41.410
was couples only,
but great news.

02:41.446 --> 02:42.812
We're now
a couple.

02:42.847 --> 02:44.614
Oh. Who's this?

02:44.649 --> 02:46.682
This is Kimmie.
I met her in a pop-up window

02:46.718 --> 02:48.584
on the Internet.
She was in my area.

02:48.620 --> 02:50.153
Hi. Peter Griffin,

02:50.188 --> 02:51.420
Oh, right on.

02:51.456 --> 02:53.890
All right, well,
I suppose I could look into

02:53.925 --> 02:55.558
adding you two
to the reservation.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.660
Yeah, you guys
should definitely come.

02:57.695 --> 02:59.162
Yeah, this
is gonna be awesome.

02:59.197 --> 03:00.263

03:00.298 --> 03:01.931
Geez, I haven't
seen you this excited

03:01.966 --> 03:04.734
since you got that letter
sent by carrier owl.

03:04.769 --> 03:07.737
Oh, my God. Is this my
acceptance to Hogwarts?

03:07.772 --> 03:09.739
No, it's a letter
asking you

03:09.774 --> 03:11.641
to stop throwing rocks
at my nest.

03:11.676 --> 03:14.343
You hit one of my kids,
and now he can't fly right.

03:14.379 --> 03:16.979
Well, fine, then I'll just
throw rocks at the hornets.

Who wants some?

No one? What's wrong
with you people?

05:19.771 --> 05:22.371
Dick Fosbury won
an Olympics on this.

05:22.407 --> 05:23.806
Well, say, this is pretty neat.

05:23.841 --> 05:26.876
I brought you kids an old seed
packet I found in my garage.

I know what you got
your fingers crossed for,

05:29.113 --> 05:30.946

that all kids love:

05:37.522 --> 05:38.754
coffee and
old seed packets.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.656
And all any of you
can do is stare

05:40.692 --> 05:43.025
at those Game Boy machines!
I'm sick of it!

05:43.061 --> 05:46.228
In fact, for the rest
of the week, no more screens.

have fun the old-fashioned way,

I was a kid.

to the old swimmin' hole

07:47.716 --> 07:48.948
and swim in a hole.

07:48.984 --> 07:50.784

It's called jacks.

08:03.331 --> 08:04.798
Got one!

08:04.833 --> 08:07.267
Will I get two?
Come get in on this.

08:07.302 --> 08:09.803
Wait, this-this game
is cleaning up toys?

08:09.838 --> 08:11.805
Carter, read the room.
They're not into it.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.073
All right,

08:13.108 --> 08:14.174
I just don't want
you kids sitting

08:23.351 --> 08:24.784
Bend to the left.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.586

08:33.562 --> 08:35.195

your neck.

08:35.230 --> 08:36.996
Tuck it in
your shirt.

somebody and hang up.

08:55.751 --> 08:58.084
All right, our first
counseling exercise will be

08:58.120 --> 09:01.221
speaking to each other
with "I feel" statements.

09:01.256 --> 09:02.856
Lois, please begin.

finding it in my food.

09:52.307 --> 09:53.940

Sor-sorry, what-what is it?

09:58.513 --> 09:59.879
What's the question?

10:04.886 --> 10:07.520
Okay, last night I did some
personality assessments

10:07.556 --> 10:09.756
based on yesterday's session,
and what I found

10:09.791 --> 10:11.257
was none of
you couples

10:11.293 --> 10:13.626
are compatible with
each other at all.

10:17.098 --> 10:18.932
No, no, no, that's
not a good thing.

10:18.967 --> 10:21.334
But, interestingly,
you have high compatibility

10:21.369 --> 10:23.069
with other people
in this group.

10:23.104 --> 10:24.904
Oh, my God.
That is crazy.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.806
More mac and cheese.
Here, just keep it going.

10:26.842 --> 10:28.408
Keep it going... don't be
afraid of the burned edges.

10:28.443 --> 10:29.443
Just give me the tray.

10:29.444 --> 10:30.543
Wait, so what happened?

10:30.579 --> 10:32.579
Anyway, I'd like
to do an exercise.

10:32.614 --> 10:34.614
Just for the morning,
you'll all be paired

10:34.649 --> 10:36.082
with your
more compatible match.

10:36.117 --> 10:38.017
And hopefully,
you'll bring some lessons back

10:38.053 --> 10:40.486
from that experience
into your marriages.

10:40.522 --> 10:42.455
Okay, so the new
couple pairings

10:42.490 --> 10:44.524
are as follows:
Cleveland and Lois...

10:44.559 --> 10:48.394
Oh, cool! My FICO score
just went up a hundred points.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.129
...Quagmire
and Bonnie,

10:50.165 --> 10:51.798
Joe and Donna,

10:51.833 --> 10:53.199
and Peter
and Kimmie.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.768
Yay! I win
couples counseling!

11:01.376 --> 11:03.676
Look at those
hairless shins.

11:03.712 --> 11:05.178
They're magnificent.

11:05.213 --> 11:06.813
Decades of black
dress socks

11:06.848 --> 11:09.282
have rendered them
smooth and mirror-like.

11:09.317 --> 11:11.484
Grandpa, what are we
even doing out here?

11:11.519 --> 11:13.453
Looking for shapes
in the clouds.

11:13.488 --> 11:15.922
That one looks like the Thompson
Throat Lozenge girl!

11:15.957 --> 11:18.157
See? She's got the boater on
and everything!

11:18.193 --> 11:20.126
I'm bored. Can't we
do something else?

11:20.161 --> 11:21.995
Well, back when
I was your age,

11:22.030 --> 11:24.197
there was nothing better
than knocking on doors

11:24.232 --> 11:26.633
and throwing paper bags
full of flour at people.

11:26.668 --> 11:28.902
That's a thing?
What, flour facin'?

11:28.937 --> 11:31.471
It's the best thing!
We used it to keep Italians

11:31.506 --> 11:34.207
from going to the polls.

11:37.445 --> 11:39.145
Stay home today, Guido!

11:40.916 --> 11:44.150
Yay! Old-fashioned things
are the best!

that I've watched

12:32.968 --> 12:34.567
every<i> Jurassic Park.</i>

12:34.602 --> 12:36.836
Peter, you're awesome.
You're so funny.

12:36.871 --> 12:38.871
Hey, Kimmie, I'll pay you
a thousand dollars

12:38.907 --> 12:40.974
for one whole handful
of your butt.

12:41.009 --> 12:43.042
For two handfuls,
I'll give you my car.

12:43.078 --> 12:44.444
All right,
that's enough!

12:44.479 --> 12:45.878
I have had it, Peter!

12:45.914 --> 12:48.047
So, how are the new
pairings working out?

12:48.083 --> 12:50.049
Are you all gaining
lots of insights?

12:50.085 --> 12:51.484
No! I can see now

12:51.519 --> 12:53.686
that coming here
was a huge mistake!

12:53.722 --> 12:55.355
You're hopeless, Peter!

12:55.390 --> 12:57.056
Your feet look old.

12:57.092 --> 12:59.025
This retreat is over!

12:59.060 --> 13:01.728
Fire up the boat--
we're going home!

13:04.165 --> 13:05.898
Mrs. Griffin, please,

13:05.934 --> 13:07.333
I urge you to finish
the program.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.668
No, thank you.

13:08.703 --> 13:10.203
I never should've
come here.

13:10.238 --> 13:11.871
Or at least
not with<i> him.</i>

13:11.906 --> 13:13.373
Is there anything
I can do to change...

13:20.115 --> 13:21.514
Oh, my God!

13:21.549 --> 13:23.383
We're taking this
island back.

13:23.418 --> 13:26.319
Yeah! Kill the whites!
Race war!

13:26.354 --> 13:27.453
(grunts

13:28.456 --> 13:30.523
Run! Everybody run!

13:40.902 --> 13:42.535
What the hell is happening?!

13:42.570 --> 13:44.270
Somebody do something!

13:46.574 --> 13:50.143
Look! We got to get
the attention of that plane!

13:59.754 --> 14:01.754
You got to help us!

14:07.459 --> 14:09.425
Man, those natives
are pissed!

14:09.461 --> 14:11.427
This is like
a full-blown revolution!

14:11.463 --> 14:14.163
Do you think me throwing
full sodas into the garbage

14:14.199 --> 14:16.266
had anything
to do with this?

14:18.236 --> 14:20.236
Quick!
Into the jungle!

14:25.277 --> 14:27.143
What are we gonna do?

14:27.178 --> 14:29.145
Wait a minute-- yesterday,
near the north beach,

14:29.180 --> 14:31.147
I saw a small
landing strip, giggity.

14:31.182 --> 14:34.083
It might be our best chance
to get off, giggity, the island.

14:34.119 --> 14:36.753
Did you really see that,
or was it just an excuse

14:36.788 --> 14:37.800
to say "giggity"?

14:37.824 --> 14:39.523
I don't know, baby--
I'm crazy with the heat.

14:39.524 --> 14:40.990
Take your pants off.

14:41.026 --> 14:42.859
Oh, my God,
this is legit ridic.

14:42.894 --> 14:44.360
I got to post this.

14:44.396 --> 14:48.097
Josh Radnor's
twitter feed is<i> so</i> funny!

14:48.133 --> 14:49.766
That's impossible.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.768
Geez, coming here
was a bad idea.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.604
Like when I brought
museum behavior into my home.

15:01.613 --> 15:04.781
Excuse me, we do ask that
you don't touch anything.

15:11.456 --> 15:13.856
I got to say, Carter,
you've done a good job.

15:13.892 --> 15:15.625
We'd become slaves
to our electronics.

15:15.660 --> 15:17.660
But you know what
we're doing here?

15:17.696 --> 15:19.128
We're reclaiming
our lives.

15:19.164 --> 15:21.331
You're kind of an egghead,
aren't you, Brian?

15:21.366 --> 15:24.567
Vroom! Everyone on this plane
is wearing a suit.

15:24.602 --> 15:26.102
Say, that reminds me.

15:26.137 --> 15:28.237
Everyone,
time to dress for dinner.

15:28.273 --> 15:30.173
Ooh! I want to light
the candles, Pop-Pop!

15:30.208 --> 15:32.108
Oh, boy,
I haven't had this much fun

15:32.143 --> 15:34.410

with that Bublé wrap.

15:59.604 --> 16:01.871
I know. If we die,
what's gonna happen

16:01.906 --> 16:03.606
to my mail?
What?

16:03.641 --> 16:06.442
I'm just sayin', how's the post office
supposed to know?

16:06.478 --> 16:08.978
And my DVR!
It'll be full in a week!

16:09.013 --> 16:10.813
I record<i> Ellen</i> every day!

16:10.849 --> 16:13.015
I know I shouldn't,
but whenever she dances,

16:13.051 --> 16:16.419
I'm like, "Go ahead, girl,
it's your world!"

16:16.454 --> 16:18.588
I heard she gay.

16:18.623 --> 16:21.691
Well, it seems like
we're pretty talked out.

16:23.328 --> 16:27.263
Thanks for changing your mind
about drowning me in that river.

16:31.202 --> 16:33.403
Hey. Did you see
those pictures of me

16:33.438 --> 16:35.338
doing ducklips
by a pool?

16:35.373 --> 16:37.373
I don't know,
some island.

16:37.409 --> 16:38.409
Shh!

16:40.478 --> 16:42.645
You rebel scum!

16:44.182 --> 16:46.649
Ah, you're too young.
You don't know.

16:52.457 --> 16:54.424
So, how did you guys
get captured?

16:54.459 --> 16:56.426
Quagmire screams
when he urinates.

16:56.461 --> 16:57.794
How about you?

16:57.829 --> 17:00.563
Cleveland kept stopping
to scratch his back on trees.

17:00.598 --> 17:02.331
Lois don't
do it right.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.599
Come here, baby.

17:03.635 --> 17:05.635
You need them Lee Press-Ons.

17:05.670 --> 17:07.537
Mmm. There it is.

17:07.572 --> 17:09.071
Mmm.

17:11.576 --> 17:12.642
Ah, Peter!

17:12.677 --> 17:14.477
I was so worried
about you.

17:14.512 --> 17:17.547
Lois, when we got captured,
I said, "You rebel scum,"

17:17.582 --> 17:19.549
and Kimmie didn't get it.

17:19.584 --> 17:20.650
That's funny!

17:20.685 --> 17:22.151
From<i> The Star Wars!</i>

17:22.187 --> 17:25.755
Well, just<i> Star Wars.</i>
But I missed you, sweetheart!

17:25.790 --> 17:27.824
Why are you doing this?
Let us go!

17:27.859 --> 17:30.827
Every year we have to deal
with you American tourists!

17:30.862 --> 17:34.063
Stuffing your slob faces,
taking video you'll never watch,

17:34.098 --> 17:37.333
and asking if I'm
the<i> Captain Phillips</i> guy.

17:37.368 --> 17:38.801
I'm not!

17:38.837 --> 17:40.703
Take the couples out,
two by two,

17:40.738 --> 17:42.271
and execute them.

17:46.010 --> 17:47.310
Oh, my God!

17:47.345 --> 17:50.746
Well, at least I ain't going out
with a itchy back.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.786
Oh, no!
This is terrible!

17:56.821 --> 17:59.989
Now, now, maybe
they just shot Donna twice.

18:01.059 --> 18:02.658
Bonnie, quick,
lock my wheels!

18:02.694 --> 18:05.027
We don't have
to make it easy for them!

18:08.733 --> 18:12.802
Scuffin' up those floors
pretty good!

18:15.173 --> 18:17.340
Boy, they're really
going at Donna.

18:19.210 --> 18:21.544
Any last words?

18:21.579 --> 18:23.079
Moist.

18:26.851 --> 18:31.053
Oh, Peter, I'm so sorry
I lied to get you to come here.

18:31.089 --> 18:33.189
I should've been
honest with you.

18:33.224 --> 18:35.625
Please forgive me?
I do, Lois.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.761
I know you were just trying
to do something good for our marriage.

18:38.796 --> 18:42.131
And I'm sorry I've been
such a jerk about it.

18:42.166 --> 18:43.466
I need you, Lois.

18:43.501 --> 18:44.634
I always will.

18:44.669 --> 18:47.303
And if I got to get shot
by ooga-booga people,

18:47.338 --> 18:49.205
I want it to happen
with you.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.740
Oh, Peter.

18:56.681 --> 18:59.048
I love you so much, Lois.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.716
I love you,
too, Peter.

19:00.752 --> 19:02.718
Lois, I think
you should know,

19:02.754 --> 19:05.454
I never cared for your
most recent haircut.

19:05.490 --> 19:08.190
Peter, I've had the same
haircut for 20 years.

19:08.226 --> 19:09.559
We're ready now.

19:16.834 --> 19:19.035
Congratulations,
Griffins-- you did it!

19:19.070 --> 19:21.270
You've successfully
completed the program.

19:21.306 --> 19:22.505
What?!
What?!

19:24.909 --> 19:27.743
We just found out, too!
The whole thing was staged.

19:27.779 --> 19:30.079
Noel dying,
the uprising, all of it.

19:30.114 --> 19:32.815
Oh-ho,<i> that's</i> what they
meant on their Web site:

19:32.850 --> 19:35.651
"Staged Revolution
Marital Counseling."

19:35.687 --> 19:37.653
It all makes sense.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.891
Yes, sorry to deceive you all,

19:41.926 --> 19:44.093
but we find that when couples
don't respond

19:44.128 --> 19:46.796
to traditional counseling,
the stress of extreme danger

19:46.831 --> 19:49.532
reminds them of what
matters most in their lives--

19:49.567 --> 19:51.567
their love for each other.

19:51.603 --> 19:53.603
I feel like I
should be mad, but...

19:53.638 --> 19:54.837
I guess you're right.

19:54.872 --> 19:56.939
Lois and I have
never felt closer.

19:56.975 --> 19:59.342
And I did get to kill a guy.
What?!

19:59.377 --> 20:00.943
Thanks for
everything, Noel.

20:06.017 --> 20:07.750
Well, kids,
it's Dyngus Day.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.552
Here are your
pussy willow branches.

20:09.587 --> 20:11.754
Find your sweetie
and give her a tap.

20:11.789 --> 20:14.824
Looks like I found
<i>my</i> sweetie.

20:14.859 --> 20:16.058
Oh, sarsaparilla!

20:16.094 --> 20:18.060
<i>I</i> was going to take sister!

20:18.096 --> 20:20.162
Hey, you little rats.

20:20.198 --> 20:22.064
All right, Lois, let's
just leave our bags here

20:22.100 --> 20:24.433
and wonder where our clothes
are for the next two days.

20:24.469 --> 20:25.868
How was your trip, Father?

20:25.903 --> 20:27.536
We've prepared
a song for you.

20:27.572 --> 20:28.804
Nope.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.973
Ah, boy, it's nice
to be home.

20:31.009 --> 20:33.876
Sure is, Lois.
Now, shush. TV.

20:33.911 --> 20:35.711
Television?
How pathetic.

20:35.747 --> 20:37.046
Yeah.

20:37.081 --> 20:39.682
You know where the
most interesting stuff is, Dad?

20:39.717 --> 20:41.651
The human hat.

20:41.686 --> 20:43.686
