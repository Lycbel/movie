== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

00:34.177 --> 00:36.391
Hey! Are you a big, fat bastard

00:36.526 --> 00:38.229
who loves eating at
Outback Steakhouse,

00:38.263 --> 00:40.629
but thinks the portions
are too small?

00:40.663 --> 00:42.901
Well, good news, fatass,

00:42.935 --> 00:45.635
'cause now there's
the Outback Steakhouse Extreme!

00:45.669 --> 00:47.132
We don't have a Bloomin' Onion,

00:47.174 --> 00:49.302
we have a Bloomin' Pumpkin!

00:49.344 --> 00:50.775
You know what else we got?

00:50.809 --> 00:52.112
Elephant steaks!

00:52.146 --> 00:54.083
50-pound elephant steaks!

00:54.117 --> 00:57.088
And why don't you wash it down
with 40 ounces of malt liquor

00:57.122 --> 00:58.962
and ranch dressing,
you fat!

00:58.996 --> 01:01.265
Outback Steakhouse Extreme!

01:01.299 --> 01:04.170
Punish! Your! Toilet!

01:04.204 --> 01:05.972
Aw, man,
I bet that's where

01:06.006 --> 01:08.174
Crocodile Dundee
eats every night.

01:08.208 --> 01:11.111
Everything in Australia
is so fancy.

01:11.145 --> 01:13.152
Yeah, Australia's
a beautiful place.

01:13.186 --> 01:14.352
The best thing
about going there

01:14.386 --> 01:16.153
is you get to fly
over the Pacific Ocean.

01:16.187 --> 01:17.953
The greatest ocean
of all time.

01:17.987 --> 01:19.889
Tell me you're joking.

01:19.923 --> 01:21.289
Everyone knows that,
pound for pound,

01:21.323 --> 01:22.961
the Atlantic is
the best ocean.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.697
"Pound for pound"?

01:24.731 --> 01:26.161
What are you talking about?
You can't weigh the ocean.

01:26.195 --> 01:27.561
Yeah, scientists can.

01:27.603 --> 01:28.897
They're doing
it all the time.

01:28.931 --> 01:29.969
Pick up a book.

01:30.003 --> 01:31.737
You're an idiot!
I'm an idiot?

01:31.771 --> 01:33.400
All anybody remembers
about your argument

01:33.434 --> 01:35.168
is that you're
in a wheelchair!

01:37.337 --> 01:38.576
Guys, guys...

01:38.610 --> 01:39.912
Let's stop
escalatin'

01:39.946 --> 01:41.911
and take the stairs
for a minute.

01:41.945 --> 01:43.375
What?
What are you talking about?

01:43.416 --> 01:45.542
I'm saying you both
are making good points.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.316
But sometimes two rights
can make a wrong.

01:48.350 --> 01:50.579
I just... I just like
the Pacific Ocean!

01:50.613 --> 01:52.178
It's a good ocean.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.513
And so is
the Atlantic.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.184
Isn't this
a beautiful planet

01:55.218 --> 01:56.752
you two friends live on?

01:58.091 --> 01:59.225
I guess Cleveland's right.

01:59.259 --> 02:00.825
I'm sorry I got
so hotheaded.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.161
I'm sorry, too.

02:02.195 --> 02:03.994
Here, let me turn
your foot back around.

02:04.028 --> 02:05.994
It kind of got twisted up
in our scuffle there.

02:06.028 --> 02:07.330
Wow, Cleveland.

02:07.364 --> 02:09.201
You calmed them down
just by talking

02:09.235 --> 02:10.730
with your mouth and
your pretty lips.

02:10.772 --> 02:12.170
Oh, it's nothin'.

02:12.204 --> 02:14.203
Just a little something
I learned volunteering

02:14.237 --> 02:16.340
as a youth counselor
down at my church.

02:16.374 --> 02:17.941
Pretty much
just boils down

02:17.982 --> 02:19.213
to four or five
catchphrases.

02:19.247 --> 02:20.949
Like what?

02:20.983 --> 02:22.614
Well, there's the
"stop escalatin'" one.

02:22.648 --> 02:24.254
There's
"What do you think it means?"

02:24.288 --> 02:26.022
"Pray on it, stay on it."

02:26.056 --> 02:27.886
One's just kind of like a noise:

02:27.920 --> 02:29.254
Hmm... mmm?

02:29.288 --> 02:31.023
That's amazing.

02:31.065 --> 02:32.895
Hey, you're way too good
to be doing that for free.

02:32.929 --> 02:34.559
Maybe you should
open up an office.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.040
You know, finally
start chipping away

02:36.065 --> 02:37.566
at some of that
horrendous debt you've got.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.030
Yeah, Peter's right.

02:39.072 --> 02:40.566
I mean, it's not like
you've found a job

02:40.600 --> 02:42.070
since you moved
back here anyway.

02:42.104 --> 02:44.469
You know, that's
a not-half-bad idea.

02:44.503 --> 02:48.044
And if I charge
my first patient $117,000,

02:48.078 --> 02:49.276
I'm right back in it.

02:49.310 --> 02:51.707
Thanks for spotting
my potential, Peter!

02:51.749 --> 02:53.043
Hey, no problem, buddy.

02:53.077 --> 02:54.211
I'm pretty perceptive.

02:54.245 --> 02:56.050
That's how I can
always tell which guys

02:56.084 --> 02:58.714
in the Wrangler Jeans
commercials beat their wives.

02:58.748 --> 03:00.617
All of 'em.

03:07.089 --> 03:09.009
Go around the block again,
she's still out front.

03:09.025 --> 03:10.727
We've gone around
six times.

03:10.761 --> 03:12.263
Let's just talk to her.
Eh, you're right.

03:12.297 --> 03:15.000
Rip it off quick,
like a Band-Aid.

03:15.034 --> 03:17.495
Hey, Meg, you know
Mr. Quagmire, right? Bye!

03:17.537 --> 03:19.263
Hey, what's
going on here?

03:19.305 --> 03:20.799
Oh, I'm selling
my old Beanie Babies

03:20.833 --> 03:22.103
to make money
for the prom.

03:22.137 --> 03:23.438
That seems
optimistic.

03:23.472 --> 03:25.238
But look, if you want
to make real money,

03:25.272 --> 03:26.806
I could try to get you
a job at the airport.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.605
They always need
new TSA screeners.

03:28.639 --> 03:30.677
Really?
Wow, that'd be great!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.076
Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

03:32.110 --> 03:33.812
And thanks for
taking the time.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.283
Most people aren't
usually that nice to me.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.314
Ugh, gross.

03:44.322 --> 03:47.119
Mayor West, after working
with you for some time now,

03:47.153 --> 03:50.086
I believe you are affecting
your weird behaviors.

03:50.128 --> 03:52.759
You are doing
deliberately odd things

03:52.793 --> 03:55.864
to mask dark,
maybe even criminal, activities.

03:55.898 --> 03:58.200
You are 100% aware
of what you're doing.

03:58.234 --> 04:00.831
I think you're
a dangerous sociopath.

04:00.873 --> 04:04.301
Cleveland, let me
tell you something.

04:04.335 --> 04:08.307
You're absolutely  right.

04:08.341 --> 04:11.305
Well, time to put
on my spaghetti hat!

04:16.176 --> 04:18.046
I just never feel happy.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.110
I strive for these things,
and I get them,

04:20.144 --> 04:23.119
but at the end of the day,
I still don't feel fulfilled.

04:23.153 --> 04:24.446
Hmm.

04:24.488 --> 04:27.376
This is a problem that
requires more tweed.

04:30.477 --> 04:33.678
Is it possible you're not
letting yourself be happy?

04:33.712 --> 04:35.844
Like you don't feel
like you're worth it?

04:35.878 --> 04:37.508
No, that's not it.

04:37.550 --> 04:38.876
Hmm.

04:41.319 --> 04:43.285
Maybe your accomplishments
don't feel real

04:43.320 --> 04:45.685
because your brother
isn't here to see them.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.285
Maybe...

04:47.327 --> 04:49.125
That doesn't feel
quite right, either.

04:49.159 --> 04:51.291
Hmm.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.858
You don't want to
outshine your father.

04:53.892 --> 04:55.226
Oh, my God.

04:55.260 --> 04:56.561
Oh, my God!

04:56.595 --> 04:57.961
Whew.

04:57.995 --> 05:00.201
I was damn near out of tweed.

05:11.175 --> 05:13.141
Okay, now, see?

05:13.175 --> 05:14.878
She didn't say
"good morning" to me,

05:14.912 --> 05:17.078
so I put an orange dot
on her boarding pass,

05:17.112 --> 05:19.182
which means they're going
to search her anus.

05:19.216 --> 05:20.688
I noticed you
also circled

05:20.722 --> 05:21.984
a bunch of things
on her ticket.

05:22.018 --> 05:23.256
Why did you
do that?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.352
Because otherwise,
the line moves too quickly.

05:25.394 --> 05:28.193
You see, the whole thing
we're going for here at the TSA

05:28.227 --> 05:30.361
is a sort of bored fascism.

05:30.395 --> 05:32.401
Huh.
I think I can handle that.

05:32.435 --> 05:34.834
I did not tell
you to approach!

05:34.868 --> 05:36.171
Great job!

05:36.205 --> 05:37.835
The worst thing
a passenger can do

05:37.877 --> 05:39.843
is approach your podium
before you tell them to.

05:39.877 --> 05:41.907
As bad as those
19 hijackers were,

05:41.941 --> 05:44.779
the people we see here
every day are much worse.

05:44.813 --> 05:47.212
Boy, Larry, there's
a lot to remember.

05:47.254 --> 05:49.020
I... I hope I don't
screw something up.

05:49.054 --> 05:51.220
Trust me, you have
nothing to worry about.

05:51.254 --> 05:52.284
You're basically
un-fireable.

05:52.326 --> 05:53.589
What do you mean?

05:53.623 --> 05:55.261
Come on, Meg.
Look around.

05:55.295 --> 05:57.061
You're the hottest
person who works here.

06:00.464 --> 06:02.030
Oh, wow.

06:02.064 --> 06:03.366
Now that you mention it,

06:03.400 --> 06:04.598
everybody does look
kind of dumpy.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.303
That's not entirely
their fault.

06:06.336 --> 06:09.072
They're all told to wear
a pair of their dads' pants.

06:09.114 --> 06:10.807
Oh, speaking of
which, tomorrow,

06:10.841 --> 06:13.247
bring in a pair of
your dad's pants.

06:17.248 --> 06:20.286
Peter, you promised me
you would do the dishes.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.982
Well, I was doing
the dishes for a while,

06:22.024 --> 06:23.390
but they were
inexperienced,

06:23.424 --> 06:24.759
so I ended up having
to rub one out.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.895
Where in the hell did
you get the idea that

06:26.929 --> 06:28.759
that's what I meant by
"doing the dishes"?

06:28.793 --> 06:31.062
From Dirty Amelia Bedelia.

06:31.096 --> 06:34.432
Almost done vacuuming the rug!

06:34.466 --> 06:36.602
Dammit, Peter!
You're making me crazy!

06:36.644 --> 06:37.907
Well, you know what?

06:37.941 --> 06:39.412
Sounds like you need
some counseling.

06:39.446 --> 06:40.953
Maybe you should go
talk to Cleveland.

06:40.977 --> 06:42.120
Cleveland?

06:42.121 --> 06:44.454
Why would I talk to Cleveland?
He's a therapist now,

06:44.488 --> 06:46.350
and he's really great at helping
people with their problems.

06:46.384 --> 06:48.086
Oh, I see.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.022
You want me to tell
your best friend

06:50.056 --> 06:52.255
my complaints about you
so he can back you up.

06:52.297 --> 06:54.264
The new maid is peeing on me!

06:54.298 --> 06:56.433
And she didn't even say
anything clever about it!

06:56.467 --> 06:58.467
Look, you're the one who said
you were going crazy.

06:58.499 --> 06:59.634
Just talk to him.

06:59.668 --> 07:01.274
He's all about
helping people get well.

07:01.309 --> 07:02.874
Just like Doc Martens.

07:02.908 --> 07:04.675
So, how are you feeling today?

07:04.709 --> 07:07.012
Terrible.
I've got blurry vision.

07:07.046 --> 07:08.610
I feel cold and clammy.

07:08.644 --> 07:11.145
And the nurse told me
there's blood in my stool.

07:11.179 --> 07:13.016
Have you tried
wearing a lesbian shoe?

07:13.050 --> 07:14.312
What?

07:14.354 --> 07:16.353
Put this man down for
a pair of lesbian shoes.

07:18.556 --> 07:20.956
Huh.
High fever, weight loss,

07:20.998 --> 07:23.335
and extreme
respiratory difficulty.

07:23.369 --> 07:24.536
Let's have this man intubated

07:24.570 --> 07:26.938
and fit with a pair
of lesbian shoes.

07:30.341 --> 07:31.915
Hi.

07:31.949 --> 07:33.482
Are you the next
crazy person?

07:33.516 --> 07:34.979
Um, I guess so.

07:35.013 --> 07:37.251
I've been pretty depressed
since my wife died.

07:37.285 --> 07:40.522
I'm sorry, I'm tryin' to read
the<i> Costco Connection</i> here.

07:40.556 --> 07:41.986
There they are!

07:42.020 --> 07:43.522
All right, since
you're a patient,

07:43.556 --> 07:45.090
we're gonna talk about you
like you're not here.

07:45.124 --> 07:46.722
You get all of her
squawkin' out, Doc?

07:46.764 --> 07:49.330
Oh, I think we got to
the root of the problem.

07:49.364 --> 07:51.530
Didn't we, Lois?
Absolutely.

07:51.564 --> 07:53.234
All right, let's
dope her up good.

07:53.268 --> 07:54.570
Turn that mouth off.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.370
No, Peter, the problem is you.

07:56.405 --> 07:57.667
What?

07:57.709 --> 07:58.939
What the hell are you doing?

07:58.973 --> 08:00.371
You're supposed to be my friend.

08:00.405 --> 08:03.579
Dr. Brown,
I just killed nine people!

08:03.613 --> 08:05.716
Uh, I mean,

08:05.750 --> 08:07.349
I have ducks
on my feet.

08:07.383 --> 08:09.952
Old, crazy harmless mayor.

08:09.994 --> 08:11.592
Quack quack!

08:17.018 --> 08:18.985
How can Cleveland say
I'm the problem?

08:19.019 --> 08:20.353
All I do is sit
in the bathroom

08:20.387 --> 08:21.721
and play on my phone.

08:21.755 --> 08:23.017
Swipe... wipe...

08:23.059 --> 08:24.121
swipe... wipe...

08:24.155 --> 08:26.520
wipe... swipe...
Uh-oh.

08:26.554 --> 08:27.991
That's a perfect example.

08:28.025 --> 08:30.324
You put no effort
into this marriage.

08:30.358 --> 08:32.957
Cleveland helped me see
that our entire relationship

08:32.991 --> 08:35.030
has been you doing
whatever you want

08:35.064 --> 08:36.798
and me cleaning
up the mess.

08:36.832 --> 08:37.999
By the way,
your Svengali

08:38.033 --> 08:40.370
is out there spraying
birds with a hose.

08:40.404 --> 08:41.907
Ha ha!

08:41.941 --> 08:43.382
Now you're wet!

08:43.416 --> 08:45.047
Peter, I've had enough.

08:45.081 --> 08:47.185
Cleveland and I think
we need to make some changes.

08:47.219 --> 08:48.219
Oh, come on.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.860
Are you serious?
Yeah.

08:49.894 --> 08:51.430
You're gonna start helping
around the house,

08:51.464 --> 08:53.231
and we're gonna start
doing things together.

08:53.265 --> 08:54.570
We do stuff together.

08:54.604 --> 08:56.171
Just last night,

08:56.205 --> 08:58.045
I made you keep track
of all the words I know.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.309
"Shoehorn.orn."

08:59.343 --> 09:00.940
"Engine."

09:00.982 --> 09:03.347
"Football."

09:03.381 --> 09:04.683
Did I say "shoehorn"?

09:04.717 --> 09:06.178
Yes.
Okay.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.480
"Shoehorns."

09:07.514 --> 09:09.216
Peter, please...

09:09.250 --> 09:10.950
I've got an early doctor's
appointment tomorrow.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.285
Ooh! "Early."

09:12.319 --> 09:13.548
"Doctor."
Put those on there, too.

09:13.582 --> 09:15.452
Uh, should I also put
down "appointment"?

09:15.486 --> 09:16.853
No, I don't know
what that means.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.221
Oh, "means."

09:26.295 --> 09:27.630
Wow, look at the new girl!

09:27.664 --> 09:29.135
She's so hot!

09:29.169 --> 09:30.470
Yeah, her breasts
and her stomach

09:30.504 --> 09:31.903
are different parts
of her body!

09:31.937 --> 09:33.304
I think she
looks weird.

09:33.337 --> 09:35.311
How come she's not
shaped like a potato?

09:35.345 --> 09:38.114
That's part of the
interview and everything.

09:38.148 --> 09:39.914
Whoa, sorry, ma'am,

09:39.948 --> 09:41.186
we can't let you
through security

09:41.220 --> 09:43.420
because you're "da bomb."

09:43.454 --> 09:45.325
Scott, you're not supposed
to make jokes like that!

09:45.359 --> 09:47.494
Well, I am carrying

09:47.528 --> 09:49.127
more than three
ounces of liquid.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.468
Oh, that's so
Muhammad Hot-a.

09:54.502 --> 09:56.698
You're playing a
dangerous game, Scott!

10:00.830 --> 10:02.163
All right, Peter,

10:02.197 --> 10:04.235
Cleveland says you should help
with the chores.

10:04.269 --> 10:06.130
So today, we're gonna
do laundry together.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.496
Okay.
How does this work?

10:07.538 --> 10:09.798
Well, you put the wet clothes
in the dryer,

10:09.832 --> 10:12.471
you close the door
and you wait.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.238
Oh, it just went to 39 minutes!

10:17.280 --> 10:20.077
So you... you
just stand here

10:20.111 --> 10:21.444
and watch the
whole time?

10:21.478 --> 10:22.811
Shh-shh-shh.

10:22.845 --> 10:24.474
Ah, the green shirt
went by again!

10:24.516 --> 10:26.649
If it goes around 30 times
in five minutes,

10:26.683 --> 10:28.848
you get to have a Diet Coke!

10:30.952 --> 10:32.676
All right, according
to Cleveland,

10:32.718 --> 10:34.083
it's also healthy
for couples

10:34.117 --> 10:35.681
to have shared
activities.

10:35.715 --> 10:37.743
So since you
like golf,

10:37.785 --> 10:40.077
I thought we could
play a round.

10:40.119 --> 10:42.608
So-so what do I do,
just aim for the pond?

10:42.650 --> 10:44.449
No, you're not supposed
to hit it into the water.

10:44.483 --> 10:46.112
But you hit it
into the water.

10:46.154 --> 10:47.814
I know I hit it
into the water.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.245
Why do they even have water

10:49.287 --> 10:50.612
if you're not supposed
to hit it there?

10:50.654 --> 10:52.621
Because it's fun!
We're having fun!

10:52.655 --> 10:54.957
Rah!

10:54.991 --> 10:57.292
Look, it went further
than your ball!

11:03.198 --> 11:05.259
Hey, are you doing
anything on Friday?

11:05.301 --> 11:07.098
No, I don't think so.
Why?

11:07.132 --> 11:09.663
Well, I'm doing security
at the roller rink

11:09.697 --> 11:12.094
if you want to come watch me.
Sure!

11:12.135 --> 11:14.197
Great, I'll pick
you up at 4:30.

11:14.231 --> 11:15.638
Sounds good.

11:15.672 --> 11:17.103
All right, well,
I'm up at the podium.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.839
Time to make marks
on pieces of paper

11:18.873 --> 11:21.440
no one will
ever see again.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.849
I thought we had
plans on Friday.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.990
Marla, I think we should
just be ugly friends.

11:33.929 --> 11:36.335
Dammit, Cleveland has
completely ruined my life.

11:36.369 --> 11:38.231
He's got Lois making me
help around the house

11:38.265 --> 11:39.701
and spend more
time with her.

11:39.735 --> 11:40.997
My own wife!

11:41.038 --> 11:42.332
I know what
you mean, Peter.

11:42.366 --> 11:44.138
He said I've gotta be
more open and receptive

11:44.172 --> 11:46.168
to what Bonnie wants
to do in the bedroom.

11:46.202 --> 11:49.167
Thank God I can't feel
anything back there.

11:49.201 --> 11:50.974
You know what?
Screw Cleveland.

11:51.008 --> 11:52.238
He's gonna tell
my wife stuff,

11:52.272 --> 11:54.069
I'm gonna tell his
wife a few things.

11:54.111 --> 11:55.340
What are you
talking about?

11:55.374 --> 11:57.172
Well, remember how Cleveland
banged that stripper

11:57.214 --> 11:58.508
at his bachelor party?

11:58.542 --> 12:00.308
Oh, yeah!

12:00.350 --> 12:01.610
And we were all
throwing bread at 'em?

12:01.634 --> 12:02.349
Yeah.

12:02.350 --> 12:03.884
Maybe I could tell
Donna about that.

12:03.918 --> 12:07.513
Or... remember when Cleveland
wore briefs under his boxers

12:07.547 --> 12:08.817
and we found out

12:08.851 --> 12:10.385
and he told us not
to say anything?

12:10.419 --> 12:12.153
Maybe we tell her that.

12:12.187 --> 12:13.585
Uh, I think Peter's is better.

12:13.627 --> 12:15.393
Okay, but we'll
keep mine ready.

12:15.427 --> 12:17.592
Could be the nail
in the coffin.

12:17.626 --> 12:18.927
Hey, fellas.

12:18.961 --> 12:20.359
Cleveland, it ain't cool

12:20.393 --> 12:22.230
what you've been telling Lois.
All right?

12:22.264 --> 12:23.493
You're completely
messing things up for me.

12:23.527 --> 12:24.997
And you gotta tell her
you were wrong

12:25.031 --> 12:26.334
and put things back
the way they were.

12:26.368 --> 12:28.198
I'm sorry it's
hard for you, Peter,

12:28.232 --> 12:30.502
but personal growth
isn't always easy.

12:30.536 --> 12:32.606
Look, if you don't
change what you're saying,

12:32.640 --> 12:34.742
we're gonna tell Donna
you slept with that stripper

12:34.776 --> 12:36.078
at your bachelor party.

12:38.249 --> 12:39.542
Ah! Ah!

12:45.378 --> 12:46.378
What are you doing?

12:46.418 --> 12:47.738
I'm gonna play
"Locomotive Breath"

12:47.745 --> 12:49.348
by Jethro Tull
while he runs.

12:49.382 --> 12:51.377
Why the hell would you do
something stupid like that?

12:51.411 --> 12:52.848
Careful, Peter,

12:52.882 --> 12:55.045
or you're gonna lose
two friends today.

12:59.829 --> 13:02.162
We now return
to Major League Baseball

13:02.195 --> 13:05.968
with one distractingly ugly guy
behind home plate.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.135
It's two to two
in the bottom of the sixth,

13:08.169 --> 13:11.672
and I just can't get my eyes
off that man with the tall head.

13:11.706 --> 13:14.135
It's quite a game, but man,
that guy is ugly.

13:14.177 --> 13:15.837
I'll say, Gary.
What's the count?

13:15.871 --> 13:17.538
No idea, Bill.

13:17.572 --> 13:19.673
But you know, that guy
hasn't blinked this entire game.

13:19.707 --> 13:22.874
Just a dead-eyed idiot
out on a Thursday afternoon.

13:22.908 --> 13:24.672
Yup.
And the longer I watch him,

13:24.714 --> 13:26.805
the more I wonder
if he's there by himself.

13:26.839 --> 13:28.202
I think you're
on to something there.

13:28.244 --> 13:30.336
That seat next to him's
been empty for hours.

13:30.378 --> 13:31.975
Right you are, Gary.

13:32.009 --> 13:35.804
I'm gonna see if
I can hit him with my apple.

13:35.846 --> 13:38.009
Ah. Kind of short-armed it.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.977
Oh, I'll get to
the bottom of this.

13:40.011 --> 13:41.210
Take care, Donna.

13:43.284 --> 13:45.747
Cleveland didn't show up to
my therapy session earlier,

13:45.789 --> 13:47.986
and Donna says she hasn't
seen him for two days.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.817
Interesting.
Interesting.

13:50.859 --> 13:53.592
She also weirdly told me
that she squatted 250 today.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.193
I'm not even sure
if that's good.

13:55.227 --> 13:56.826
It's scary good.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.132
Well, I am off

13:58.166 --> 13:59.965
to try and get out
of this conversation.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.471
Peter, what
did you do?

14:01.505 --> 14:04.409
He was slightly inconveniencing
me and Joe,

14:04.443 --> 14:06.547
so we threatened
to destroy his family.

14:06.581 --> 14:08.811
What?
I know, right?! It's pretty galling.

14:08.853 --> 14:10.851
No, I'm not taking
your side, Peter!

14:10.885 --> 14:12.387
Whatever the
hell you did,

14:12.421 --> 14:14.153
you go find him
and bring him back!

14:14.187 --> 14:15.553
All right,
I'll go find him.

14:15.587 --> 14:16.889
God, I'm sorry.

14:16.923 --> 14:17.952
You're makin' me feel lower

14:17.986 --> 14:19.920
than a squid at
the bottom of the ocean.

14:22.498 --> 14:25.235
Wow, it really inks in here.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.271
What is that?

14:39.312 --> 14:40.646
There you are.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.247
Listen up, Meg:

14:42.281 --> 14:44.752
this TSA isn't sweaty
enough for the two of us.

14:44.786 --> 14:46.816
What?
What does that even mean?

14:46.850 --> 14:48.953
It means, stay away
from Larry.

14:48.987 --> 14:51.290
I'm his girlfriend.
You are?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.962
Oh, my God, I thought
you were a boy.

14:52.996 --> 14:54.489
Oh, that's it!

14:59.303 --> 15:01.701
I will cut you, bitch.

15:02.143 --> 15:03.437
Ow!

15:03.471 --> 15:04.974
That hurt a little bit.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.797
This ain't over.

15:29.831 --> 15:31.301
Larry is mine.

15:33.007 --> 15:35.038
What the hell?
Th-That was crazy!

15:35.072 --> 15:38.110
Like-like crazier
than putting cops on Segways.

15:38.144 --> 15:39.277
Help, officer!

15:39.311 --> 15:40.973
There's a lady being
raped in that alley!

15:41.015 --> 15:44.612
Okay, hold on, let me do
a small dippy-bob turn.

15:44.646 --> 15:45.948
I couldn't
be sure,

15:45.982 --> 15:48.115
but I-I think the
man has a knife!

15:48.149 --> 15:50.146
Are there any steps
leading to that alley

15:50.188 --> 15:52.985
or is it just a series
of gentle ramps?

15:56.026 --> 15:58.119
Okay, guys, Lois wants me
to find Cleveland.

15:58.153 --> 16:00.822
And since he eats, like,
nine candy bars a day,

16:00.856 --> 16:02.387
if we wait here
at the convenience store,

16:02.421 --> 16:03.954
he's bound
to show up.

16:03.988 --> 16:05.792
Hey, can you buy
us some beer?

16:05.826 --> 16:07.959
I don't know, I don't
think it'd be right.

16:07.993 --> 16:09.729
Ugh, I knew you weren't cool.

16:09.763 --> 16:11.697
Well, now, now,
hold on a minute...

16:11.731 --> 16:13.362
See? This is
pretty cool, huh?

16:13.404 --> 16:14.898
Yeah, I guess.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.137
But what we could
really use is some weed.

16:17.171 --> 16:18.505
I think that might
be over the line.

16:18.539 --> 16:20.906
See?
I told you this guy wasn't cool.

16:20.940 --> 16:22.641
Well, now, now,
hold on a minute...

16:22.675 --> 16:25.513
Mr. Griffin,
did you or did you not

16:25.547 --> 16:28.051
distribute alcohol
and marijuana to minors?

16:28.085 --> 16:29.652
No, Your Honor,
I did not.

16:29.686 --> 16:31.558
Told you this defendant
wasn't cool.

16:31.592 --> 16:34.023
Well, now, now, now,
hold on a minute...

16:37.265 --> 16:39.199
Still no sign of Cleveland?

16:39.233 --> 16:40.567
Yeah. I was thinking
maybe our best bet

16:40.601 --> 16:42.063
is to just drive
around town

16:42.105 --> 16:43.199
and see if we
can spot him.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.374
Okay, well, he's not at
the mini golf course.

16:50.913 --> 16:53.447
Okay, he's still not at
the mini golf course.

16:56.051 --> 16:58.186
Oh, wow. Look at
that windmill.

16:58.220 --> 17:00.388
Peter, do you want to go mini golfing?
Yes.

17:02.631 --> 17:04.894
Well, he wasn't
by the sno-cones!

17:04.928 --> 17:06.905
I love today!

17:11.138 --> 17:12.208
Hi, Meg.

17:12.242 --> 17:13.904
Larry, what are
you doing here?

17:13.946 --> 17:15.576
I-I thought we were gonna
meet at the Tumi store

17:15.610 --> 17:17.247
and see who buys
luggage at the airport.

17:17.281 --> 17:19.143
Meg, I've got some
disturbing news.

17:19.177 --> 17:21.415
Some Grey security tubs
have gone missing.

17:21.449 --> 17:23.215
Oh, my God! The ones
we have a zillion of

17:23.249 --> 17:24.814
but are somehow never there
when people need them?

17:24.848 --> 17:26.086
That's right,

17:26.120 --> 17:27.800
and I'm going to have
to check your locker.

17:30.119 --> 17:32.725
I don't need to tell you
how serious this is.

17:32.759 --> 17:34.989
Wait, Larry!
I was framed!

17:35.031 --> 17:36.229
I bet it was Marla!

17:36.263 --> 17:38.123
I'm sorry, Meg,
you're fired.

17:38.165 --> 17:40.729
I'm going to need
your small, ridiculous tie.

17:40.763 --> 17:42.265
You're firing me?

17:42.299 --> 17:43.928
I have a duty
to this country.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.632
And with people
like you stealing tubs,

17:45.666 --> 17:48.170
how are we ever going
to catch Abu Nazir?

17:48.204 --> 17:49.802
That's not even
a real person.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.139
That's the terrorist
from<i> Homeland.</i>

17:51.173 --> 17:52.242
And they caught him.

17:52.276 --> 17:53.537
Good-bye, Meg.

17:55.673 --> 17:57.109
Good-bye, Larry.

17:59.677 --> 18:02.145
Meg?

18:02.179 --> 18:04.776
I'll miss the way you reminded
people about their belts.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.116
We've looked everywhere.

18:14.150 --> 18:16.253
Where the hell could he be?

18:16.287 --> 18:18.167
Guys, I think we need to
embrace the possibility

18:18.191 --> 18:19.925
that Cleveland
never existed.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.188
Dammit, if only there was
some kind of clue

18:21.221 --> 18:22.522
as to where
he might be.

18:27.133 --> 18:28.860
That's right,
Cleveland had a deli!

18:28.902 --> 18:30.196
We should
check there!

18:42.336 --> 18:44.269
Cleveland!
Cleveland!

18:44.311 --> 18:46.173
Oh, sweet! Egg salad!

18:46.207 --> 18:49.445
Peter, this place has been
closed for six years.

18:49.479 --> 18:50.709
So what?

18:50.751 --> 18:52.045
Egg salad don't go bad.

18:54.151 --> 18:55.820
Son of a whore!
Give me some milk!

18:58.989 --> 19:00.723
Okay, that helped.

19:00.757 --> 19:02.324
Jeez, this place is a dump.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.153
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

19:05.690 --> 19:08.327
It's a symbol
of all my failures.

19:08.361 --> 19:10.558
Cleveland!
You're okay!

19:10.592 --> 19:12.126
I'm so glad
we found you!

19:12.160 --> 19:14.564
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
we threatened to blab

19:14.598 --> 19:16.132
about your bachelor
party stripper stuff.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.899
I'd never do that.

19:17.933 --> 19:19.730
'Cause that'd mean I'd
have to talk to Donna,

19:19.764 --> 19:21.465
and that's... that's
just, like, "ugh."

19:21.499 --> 19:24.662
And I'm sorry I caused such
problems in your marriage.

19:24.704 --> 19:27.732
Truth is, I was faking it
as a therapist.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.332
I've been back almost a year

19:30.373 --> 19:32.137
and I still got
nothing going on.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.070
Hey, cheer up,
Cleveland.

19:35.104 --> 19:36.334
What are you
talking about?

19:36.368 --> 19:38.535
I'm a cop.
Oh. W-Wait, that's real?

19:38.577 --> 19:40.544
I thought that was, like,
a Make-A-Wish thing.

19:40.578 --> 19:42.681
All right, come on, buddy.
Let's get out of here.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.977
And, you know,
even though

19:44.012 --> 19:45.346
therapy might not
be your thing,

19:45.380 --> 19:46.817
you've got a job.

19:46.851 --> 19:48.882
As my fourth
best friend.

19:48.924 --> 19:51.353
After the dog?
After the dog.

19:55.858 --> 19:58.161
Peter, thanks for going
to find Cleveland

19:58.195 --> 19:59.361
and bringing
him home safely.

19:59.395 --> 20:01.195
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

20:01.237 --> 20:03.035
Hey, what about you, Meg?
What'd you do this week?

20:03.069 --> 20:04.499
What, so you can
make fun of me?

20:04.541 --> 20:06.338
No, Meg.
I'm your father,

20:06.372 --> 20:08.168
and I'm interested in what
my daughter did this week.

20:08.202 --> 20:10.335
You promise you're not
gonna make fun of me?

20:10.369 --> 20:12.206
Of course, Meg.
I care about my family.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.508
But I-I feel like
you're drawing this out,

20:14.542 --> 20:17.371
so when you do make fun of me,
it'll hurt more.

20:17.412 --> 20:19.273
What? Well,
that hurts, Meg.

20:19.307 --> 20:21.105
You know, you can
be very hurtful.

20:21.147 --> 20:22.345
I'm asking you,
please--

20:22.379 --> 20:23.777
and-and you don't
have to tell me,

20:23.811 --> 20:25.218
I want to know because
I'm interested--

20:25.252 --> 20:26.577
what you did
this week.

20:26.619 --> 20:28.951
It enhances my life to
know how yours is going.

20:28.985 --> 20:30.182
You promise?

20:30.216 --> 20:32.214
Okay, well, now you
owe me an apology.

20:32.256 --> 20:33.350
I'm sorry.

20:33.384 --> 20:34.916
I'm not used to you
wanting to know...

20:34.950 --> 20:37.354
Of course, I'd love
to tell you what happened.

20:37.388 --> 20:39.219
Then by all means.
I-- It's just upsetting

20:39.253 --> 20:40.955
when you thumb your
nose at the family.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.227
But I love you, and
I'm looking forward

20:42.261 --> 20:44.396
to hearing what
you have to say.

20:44.430 --> 20:45.430
Please.

20:45.462 --> 20:47.132
I'd like to hear.

20:47.166 --> 20:48.196
Oh. Okay.

20:48.230 --> 20:49.531
Well, this is
actually kind of funny.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.363
I joined the TSA...
