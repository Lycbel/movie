00:41.991 --> 00:43.459
Hey, bro!

00:43.493 --> 00:46.459
Hey! You requesting a song or
ordering some sliced meat?

00:46.501 --> 00:48.795
Meat! Half a pound
of turkey, please.

00:48.829 --> 00:50.127
You want a sample?

00:50.161 --> 00:51.800
You mean like
a slice of turkey,

00:51.834 --> 00:54.134
or like a short section
of one musical recording

00:54.168 --> 00:56.797
that's been digitally repurposed
to be part of a new song?

00:56.831 --> 00:57.831
I don't know.

00:57.837 --> 00:59.799
I might quit this job.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.859
God, late-night TV
is all terrible.

01:01.893 --> 01:03.526
Oh, we don't have
to watch this.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.922
We could turn to channel 875
and watch<i> Conan.</i>

01:05.956 --> 01:07.654
Here, let me see
what else is on.

01:10.355 --> 01:13.148
In honor of Sammy,
on the bus ride over here,

01:13.183 --> 01:14.651
we all sat in the back.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.255
Lucille Ball was
back there with us,

01:20.289 --> 01:22.257
and I saw her smoking a Cuban.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.123
Then Desi zipped up his fly.

01:26.860 --> 01:28.465
Whose wedding is this?

01:28.499 --> 01:29.833
It's hilarious.

01:29.867 --> 01:31.629
Peter, it's not a wedding,
it's an infomercial

01:31.663 --> 01:33.490
for<i> The Dean Martin</i>
<i>Celebrity Roasts.</i>

01:33.532 --> 01:35.332
Wait, you mean Comedy Central
didn't invent those?

01:35.366 --> 01:36.331
No.

01:36.365 --> 01:37.498
Well, what about funny news?

01:37.532 --> 01:38.496
Did they invent that?

01:38.530 --> 01:39.494
N-Not really.

01:39.528 --> 01:40.661
But they invented comedy.

01:40.695 --> 01:41.827
They didn't
invent anything.

01:41.861 --> 01:44.159
Well, they centralized it,
that we know.

01:44.193 --> 01:45.494
Man, look at these people.

01:45.528 --> 01:46.661
They don't breathe.

01:46.695 --> 01:48.330
They just drink
and smoke and laugh.

01:48.364 --> 01:49.392
I want to do that.

01:49.426 --> 01:50.466
What are you
talking about?

01:50.498 --> 01:51.663
You want to
have a roast?

01:51.697 --> 01:53.328
Yeah! Look, he's the man
of the hour.

01:53.362 --> 01:54.327
Everybody loves him.

01:54.361 --> 01:55.830
They got his picture
in a circle.

01:55.864 --> 01:56.997
How do they do that?

01:57.031 --> 01:59.130
Pictures come in squares.

02:03.173 --> 02:04.803
Hey, Cleveland,
how tall are you?

02:04.837 --> 02:05.802
I don't know.

02:05.836 --> 02:07.800
Cadillac come up
to about here on me.

02:07.842 --> 02:09.805
All right, so I guess I am
the tallest one of us.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.602
What are you talking
about? I'm six-two.

02:11.636 --> 02:13.631
Says so right here on
my driver's license.

02:13.665 --> 02:14.825
Yeah, that-that
doesn't count.

02:14.832 --> 02:15.832
Why not?

02:15.838 --> 02:17.129
You're gonna
make me say it?

02:17.163 --> 02:18.463
Lay me out
on the floor.

02:18.497 --> 02:19.798
I'm six-two.

02:19.832 --> 02:20.798
Hey, you guys.

02:20.832 --> 02:22.270
Peter, how tall am I?

02:22.304 --> 02:24.135
I don't know,
how tall is a mailbox?

02:24.169 --> 02:25.471
You're about
a mailbox.

02:25.505 --> 02:27.807
But listen, I-I want
you guys to roast me.

02:27.841 --> 02:29.808
What, you mean
like they do on TV?

02:29.842 --> 02:31.975
That's right, I want to be
the man of the hour.

02:32.009 --> 02:34.477
And I want all my pals
to give me a good ribbing.

02:34.511 --> 02:36.812

02:42.248 --> 02:44.213
Huh, all right,
that could be fun.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.547
Great. And you fellas
shouldn't pull any punches.

02:46.581 --> 02:47.714
Just let me have it.

02:47.748 --> 02:49.048
Nothing is off-limits.

02:49.082 --> 02:50.479
Geez, Peter,
you're more excited

02:50.513 --> 02:52.646
than Adrian Peterson
at an arboretum.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.316
Daddy, what kind
of tree is that?

02:55.350 --> 02:59.483
Man, I want to beat you
with so many things around here.

03:05.863 --> 03:08.496
Ladies and gentlemen
and people who have wandered in

03:08.538 --> 03:10.502
from the Chinese wedding
next door,

03:10.537 --> 03:12.836
welcome to the roast
of Peter Griffin,

03:12.870 --> 03:15.801
with your roast master
Glenn Quagmire.

03:17.505 --> 03:19.145
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

03:19.168 --> 03:20.797
Joe, I'd tell you
to take your seat,

03:20.839 --> 03:23.203
but I'd be
about 15 years too late.

03:26.434 --> 03:28.071
Ha! And we're off.

03:28.105 --> 03:31.074
Well, what can I say about the
man of the hour, Peter Griffin?

03:31.107 --> 03:32.578
Oh, boy, here
it comes.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.912
Well, first off,
Peter's always been special.

03:34.946 --> 03:36.575
In high school,
he didn't play sports,

03:36.609 --> 03:37.848
but he did wear a helmet.

03:41.925 --> 03:43.220
All right, that's kind of funny.

03:43.254 --> 03:44.556
Tough, but fair.

03:44.590 --> 03:47.061
You know, Peter, I love
your chin, but I got to ask.

03:47.095 --> 03:48.397
What's it like
going through life

03:48.431 --> 03:50.062
with a scrotum
so close to your mouth?

03:50.103 --> 03:51.103
You know what, hold on.

03:51.104 --> 03:52.335
I'll just ask
your teenage daughter.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.176
That... that's inappropriate.

03:58.210 --> 04:00.175
You know, Peter's
challenging the stereotype

04:00.209 --> 04:02.446
of Irish guys being fat,
drunk and stupid

04:02.480 --> 04:05.349
by throwing "a little gay"
in there, too.

04:06.751 --> 04:08.717
Oh, nice, homophobia.

04:08.751 --> 04:11.386
But I got to say, the worst part
of being Peter's friend is

04:11.420 --> 04:13.048
knowing that eventually
you're gonna have to be

04:13.082 --> 04:14.383
the fat-ass's pallbearer.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.283
Lift with the legs,
right fellas?

04:20.785 --> 04:23.582
P-People think I'm fat?

04:23.616 --> 04:25.936
But seriously, everyone, let's
have a big round of applause

04:25.953 --> 04:28.588
for the real hero tonight:
Peter's chair.

04:28.622 --> 04:30.083
How you
holding up, buddy?

04:32.091 --> 04:34.719
Two chair jokes
in the same monologue.

04:34.753 --> 04:36.391
Sloppy.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.590
Peter's got a small penis,

04:40.624 --> 04:43.627
but, hey, nothing
grows in the shade.

04:43.661 --> 04:45.121
This just in...

04:45.163 --> 04:47.727
is what Peter had to say to
his wife on their wedding night,

04:47.761 --> 04:49.128
so she knew it was
actually happening.

04:49.161 --> 04:51.127
Peter's so ugly,
he couldn't get raped

04:51.161 --> 04:53.062
in our holding cell
down at the station.

04:53.096 --> 04:54.660
For those of you who don't know,

04:54.702 --> 04:57.132
we have a real serious problem
with people getting raped

04:57.166 --> 04:59.436
in our holding cell
down at the station.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.437
Hi, I'm Professor Comedy.

05:01.471 --> 05:03.469
No!

05:03.511 --> 05:06.142
Peter, you're loud,
you can't hold down a job,

05:06.176 --> 05:08.142
and you got high blood pressure.

05:08.184 --> 05:11.486
You could be a black guy if your
ding-a-ling wasn't so damn tiny.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.621
How does everyone know?!

05:14.655 --> 05:16.621
Peter moves his lips
while he's reading,

05:16.655 --> 05:19.290
'cause he's trying
to eat the book.

05:19.324 --> 05:21.057
Roasted!

05:21.091 --> 05:22.719
You know, as Lois's father,

05:22.753 --> 05:24.717
I hate the thought of her
having sex with Peter.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.051
And so do I!

05:26.085 --> 05:28.050
Damn it, Lois, you stepped
on my punch line!

05:28.092 --> 05:29.322
Shut up! You're drunk!

05:29.356 --> 05:30.586
Stop serving her!

05:30.628 --> 05:32.923
I asked Peter
what he got on his S.A.T.s.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.562
He said, "Mayonnaise."

05:34.596 --> 05:38.233
Peter's so fat and stupid,
Lamar Odom tried to bang him.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.572
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
now that we've had our fun,

05:46.606 --> 05:49.912
it's time to give our man of the
hour a chance to have his say.

05:49.954 --> 05:52.585
Please put your hands together
for Peter Griffin!

05:55.028 --> 05:57.660
Okay, yeah,
I got something to say.

05:57.694 --> 05:58.996
Screw all you guys!

05:59.030 --> 06:00.994
I hope you all eat turds
and die!

06:01.028 --> 06:03.329
None of you bastards
are my friends no more!

06:07.172 --> 06:09.308
Brian was the
worst one.

06:16.013 --> 06:18.514
Family, I have
an announcement to make.

06:18.548 --> 06:19.850
Peter, we're eating.

06:19.884 --> 06:22.185
Just tell us what color it was
and be done with it.

06:22.219 --> 06:25.185
On account of my buddies
all being nasty sons of bitches,

06:25.219 --> 06:27.185
I've decided I'm gonna
find new friends.

06:27.219 --> 06:29.518
Oh, come on, you're
overreacting.

06:29.552 --> 06:31.190
The roast was
your idea.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.190
You asked them to
make fun of you.

06:33.224 --> 06:34.860
Yeah, but I thought
they'd stick to material

06:34.895 --> 06:37.197
about how I'm too handsome
to work at a brewery,

06:37.231 --> 06:39.864
or-or how I have tiny
little baby sneezes.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.677
I'm sure it was all
meant in good fun.

06:43.711 --> 06:46.544
Yeah, it was supposed to be fun,
but it was humiliating.

06:46.586 --> 06:48.849
I felt like
a premature volcano.

06:48.883 --> 06:50.521
I just think you're a
really cool island,

06:50.555 --> 06:52.017
and I'd like to
get to know...

06:52.059 --> 06:53.688
Oh, God!

06:53.722 --> 06:55.023
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:55.057 --> 06:57.359
I am so sorry--
you're just so pretty.

06:57.394 --> 06:59.626
Please, don't tell
the other islands.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.130
I've been thinking.

07:01.164 --> 07:03.804
Maybe I got to find friends who
can't make fun of my appearance

07:03.838 --> 07:06.139
'cause they're
weird-looking themselves.

07:06.173 --> 07:09.474
Like those two bearded dwarves
walking across the street there.

07:09.508 --> 07:13.147
Hey, will you bearded
dwarves be friends with me?

07:13.181 --> 07:15.484
We, sir, are
Italian children.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.518
Good day.

07:20.455 --> 07:21.925
Thanks for hanging out
with me.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.262
I never thought of my kids'
principal as being a friend.

07:24.296 --> 07:26.727
Well, "pal" is right
there in the name, Peter.

07:26.761 --> 07:27.967
Yeah.

07:28.001 --> 07:29.864
Hey, it's cool you got
the keys to the school,

07:29.898 --> 07:31.905
and we can hang out
when no one else is here.

07:31.939 --> 07:32.905
What should we do?

07:32.939 --> 07:34.537
Oh, I got a few ideas.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.377
Wow, I've never drank
so much milk in my life.

07:38.411 --> 07:39.713
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

07:39.747 --> 07:41.049
What other ideas you got?

07:41.083 --> 07:43.050
How about this second
fridge of milk?

07:43.084 --> 07:45.050
Uh, how much milk
do you drink?

07:45.084 --> 07:47.584
I just drink milk until
somebody stops me.

07:51.590 --> 07:52.987
I don't know.

07:53.021 --> 07:55.647
Maybe I'm just not meant
to find a new group of friends.

07:55.689 --> 07:57.718
Well, Peter, you're always
welcome to hang out with me.

07:57.752 --> 07:59.552
Yeah, but I'm talking
about the kind of friend

07:59.591 --> 08:02.053
that doesn't bark at horses
when I'm watching a movie.

08:02.087 --> 08:04.051
Fine, fine, you want to get
trampled in your living room?

08:04.093 --> 08:05.187
Be my guest.

08:05.221 --> 08:06.860
It's just...

08:06.894 --> 08:09.525
I don't know, I-I don't seem
to fit in anywhere.

08:09.567 --> 08:11.861
All right, I'm gonna
go get some more coffee

08:11.902 --> 08:13.900
and maybe a gross
microwaved sandwich.

08:15.069 --> 08:17.033
Excuse me.

08:17.068 --> 08:18.698
Can I please have
another no-foam latte?

08:18.740 --> 08:20.139
Uh, yeah, sure.

08:20.173 --> 08:21.706
But, you know,
I don't work here.

08:21.740 --> 08:22.873
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:22.907 --> 08:24.808
You look just like
one of the baristas.

08:24.842 --> 08:26.671
He doesn't look
that much like me.

08:26.705 --> 08:28.206
I think she meant me.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.805
Oh. Oh, yeah.

08:29.846 --> 08:31.141
I could see that.

08:31.175 --> 08:32.478
Hey, we should make out.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.847
You got it, mister.

08:36.451 --> 08:39.058
Double-foam, am I right?

08:40.092 --> 08:41.393
You're funny.

08:41.427 --> 08:43.394
Yeah. Oh, my God,
you're so twisted.

08:43.428 --> 08:45.730
I'm Jamie, and this is
Becca and Karen.

08:45.764 --> 08:46.994
You want to join us?

08:47.036 --> 08:48.363
Sure.
Great.

08:48.407 --> 08:50.437
We were just debating
if Jamie should hook up

08:50.471 --> 08:52.342
with this guy she met
a few nights ago.

08:52.376 --> 08:54.849
Okay, I want the deets,
like, yesterday.

08:54.883 --> 08:57.018
Wh-What the hell?
Did I just say that?

08:57.052 --> 08:58.018
You sure did.

08:58.052 --> 09:00.018
You're a natural
at this.

09:00.052 --> 09:01.353
Wh-What is "this"?

09:01.387 --> 09:03.690
It's what we do!

09:05.659 --> 09:08.055
Wow, you know,
I know I just met you guys,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.960
but I've kind of been looking
for a new group of friends.

09:10.994 --> 09:13.001
D-Do you maybe have room
for one more?

09:13.035 --> 09:15.000
Are you good at talking
about how busy you are?

09:15.034 --> 09:16.696
Because that's a lot
of what this is.

09:16.737 --> 09:19.031
Ugh, yeah, but don't talk
to me about anything

09:19.073 --> 09:20.367
until I've had
my morning coffee,

09:20.400 --> 09:22.468
'cause it's like
I can't even deal.

09:22.502 --> 09:25.139
Well, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

09:25.173 --> 09:27.801
we'd love to have you in
our group of girlfriends.

09:27.843 --> 09:29.136
Oh, my God,
that's awesome!

09:29.170 --> 09:30.472
Hey, can I be the one

09:30.506 --> 09:32.473
who laugh-screams
really loud at restaurants?

09:32.507 --> 09:34.743
As long as you're
picking up the check.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.478
Oh, we're gonna ruin
so many people's evenings!

09:38.512 --> 09:40.812
Oh, boy, I'm blending
right in with you gals.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.651
Like a panda bear
on a bed full of pillows.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.778
I'm hiding from the zoo.

09:45.820 --> 09:47.249
They want me to have a baby.

09:47.283 --> 09:49.184
I don't want to have a baby!

09:53.257 --> 09:55.052
Hey, isn't it funny
that you guys came over

09:55.086 --> 09:56.880
for a dinner party,
and all we're doing is

09:56.922 --> 09:58.551
standing in the
kitchen, drinking wine?

09:58.585 --> 09:59.982
All our
toothbrushes were

10:00.016 --> 10:01.822
in that one woman's
glass this morning.

10:01.856 --> 10:05.157
Girls, it is so nice to
be part of a group again.

10:05.191 --> 10:06.823
And I'm having
the best time.

10:06.865 --> 10:09.430
Especially yesterday when
we all got mammograms.

10:11.463 --> 10:14.825
If I have cancer,
we're all going to Brazil.

10:14.867 --> 10:16.161
So what's for dinner?

10:16.195 --> 10:17.496
You said we were
having Italian?

10:17.530 --> 10:19.168
Yeah, and then I
realized I'm not good

10:19.202 --> 10:20.832
at making
fettuccine Alfredo,

10:20.866 --> 10:23.167
but I am good at
making reservations.

10:24.202 --> 10:25.202
Do you get it?

10:25.204 --> 10:26.843
Oh, God, I'm so bad.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.844
Stewie, it's time
for your bath.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.845
Oh, what's
going on in here?

10:30.887 --> 10:31.853
Oh, hey, Lois.

10:31.887 --> 10:32.854
Hey, these are
my new friends:

10:32.888 --> 10:34.518
Jamie, Karen
and Becca.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.086
Karen's the one
with the mommy blog,

10:36.120 --> 10:38.850
so if you think you know her
from somewhere, that's where.

10:38.892 --> 10:40.688
Oh, nice to meet
you all.

10:40.690 --> 10:42.420
Would you like to
join us for dinner?

10:42.454 --> 10:44.555
Oh, no, I don't want
to get in the way.

10:44.589 --> 10:47.493
Besides, I got to get
this little man in the tub.

10:47.527 --> 10:50.061
Great. Now they're all
picturing my wiener.

10:51.566 --> 10:52.796
Oh, thank God.

10:52.830 --> 10:54.997
For a second, I thought
she was gonna come with us.

10:55.031 --> 10:56.069
What?

10:56.103 --> 10:57.933
Seriously, Peter,
how do you live with her?

10:57.967 --> 11:00.371
I know, that voice.
Ugh.

11:00.405 --> 11:02.106
And what is that hair color?

11:02.140 --> 11:03.635
Creamy French Dressing?

11:06.109 --> 11:07.780
Oh, I love it.
I love it.

11:08.814 --> 11:09.948
Yeah. Yeah.

11:09.982 --> 11:11.642
Hey, if you think that's funny,

11:11.684 --> 11:13.881
she once had a miscarriage
outside a Petco.

11:13.915 --> 11:16.079
I still have the security
camera footage somewhere.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.150
Peter, I'm your conscience,
Jiminy Cricket.

11:21.184 --> 11:22.350
Ah! Bug!

11:24.119 --> 11:27.589
Andrea, y-you set a place
for Jiminy again.

11:27.623 --> 11:30.324
Oh... so I did.

11:30.358 --> 11:31.692
Why?!

11:31.726 --> 11:34.930
Why did he have to go around
telling strangers what to do?

11:34.965 --> 11:38.299
Wasn't being a pediatric
oncologist enough for him?!

11:42.338 --> 11:44.432
He hit on me
at your wedding.

11:50.804 --> 11:52.843
Ah, let's see, what else?
What else? What else?

11:52.877 --> 11:54.475
Oh, I-I got one.
I got one.

11:54.509 --> 11:57.151
Lois tried to give CPR to
a kid at a wedding once,

11:57.186 --> 11:58.656
and when she knelt down,

11:58.690 --> 12:01.057
she accidentally high-heeled
her own stink hole.

12:03.531 --> 12:05.193
Peter, your wife
is such a pig.

12:05.227 --> 12:06.666
Oh, I don't know
about that, Jamie.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.034
Pigs eat slop,
Lois only cooks it.

12:10.173 --> 12:11.635
What the hell?

12:11.669 --> 12:13.539
Peter, can I speak
with you for a second?

12:13.573 --> 12:16.370
Oh, hang on, guys,
I got to talk to my dog.

12:16.404 --> 12:18.139
What the hell
are you doing?

12:18.181 --> 12:19.643
I'm just gabbing
with the girls.

12:19.677 --> 12:21.275
You know our cycles
have lined up?

12:21.317 --> 12:23.316
Mine's from wiping too hard.

12:23.350 --> 12:25.317
You're saying horrible things
about Lois.

12:25.351 --> 12:27.022
Oh, yeah,
it cracks up the ladies.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.590
Yesterday, Karen laughed so hard

12:28.624 --> 12:30.192
she popped a button
on her jeans.

12:30.226 --> 12:31.425
And then she cried.

12:31.499 --> 12:32.994
Peter, Lois
is your wife.

12:33.035 --> 12:34.298
You should be
defending her,

12:34.332 --> 12:37.204
not talking trash and
gossiping behind her back

12:37.238 --> 12:39.003
like some kind of
Midwestern teenager.

12:39.277 --> 12:41.497
Did you gals hear about Allie
Gallagher?

12:41.521 --> 12:43.783
She let Alan Ackerman
smack her in the back

12:43.813 --> 12:45.875
with his tallywhacker
behind the snack shack.

12:45.917 --> 12:48.011
What?
Nobody here in Maryland

12:48.045 --> 12:50.019
understands a single
word you're saying.

12:50.053 --> 12:51.587
You should move
back to Minnesota.

12:51.622 --> 12:52.820
I can't go back.

12:52.854 --> 12:54.452
I Snapchatted
Matt Gackerack

12:54.486 --> 12:56.524
a Kodak of my ass crack!

13:00.164 --> 13:01.690
Hey, Lois?

13:01.732 --> 13:04.065
I did something bad
I need to tell you about.

13:04.099 --> 13:05.361
Peter, I know.

13:05.395 --> 13:07.968
You used some of my magazines
for your fake ransom notes.

13:08.002 --> 13:09.031
It's okay.

13:09.065 --> 13:10.366
No, no, no, no,
that's not it.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.320
But did you put the ice
cream where the guy said?

13:12.337 --> 13:13.968
Because he will
hurt your family.

13:14.002 --> 13:17.073
Look, the thing is,
me and my new girlfriends,

13:17.107 --> 13:19.273
we've kind of been
talking trash about you

13:19.315 --> 13:20.714
and laughing
behind your back.

13:20.748 --> 13:22.377
Peter, of course
your new friends

13:22.411 --> 13:23.913
have been talking crap about me.

13:23.947 --> 13:25.385
That's what women do.

13:25.419 --> 13:26.385
What?

13:26.419 --> 13:28.449
So... you're not mad?

13:28.491 --> 13:31.288
Well, I'm not thrilled,
but I understand what it's like

13:31.322 --> 13:32.656
to be friends with women.

13:32.690 --> 13:35.327
I'm sure they talk trash
about you behind your back.

13:35.361 --> 13:37.127
They most
certainly do not!

13:37.161 --> 13:39.760
I guarantee you that
as soon as you leave the room,

13:39.802 --> 13:40.928
they tear you to shreds.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.096
That's not true.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.536
If it was, I would've
figured it out.

13:43.570 --> 13:46.397
Just like I figured out who was
stealing my lunch at work.

13:48.405 --> 13:50.601
Next time there's a sandwich
in the fridge

13:50.635 --> 13:53.306
with somebody's name on it,
don't eat it, scumbag!

13:53.308 --> 13:54.641
Please, you don't understand!

13:54.675 --> 13:56.007
Oh, I understand.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.775
That lunch didn't
have your name on it,

13:57.809 --> 13:59.311
but this bullet does.

14:01.514 --> 14:04.513
My name is Peter, too...!

14:09.448 --> 14:12.888
Ugh, have you guys seen
the new Jessica Biel movie?

14:12.922 --> 14:14.592
I-I don't get
what men see in her.

14:14.626 --> 14:16.424
Um, her dumper?

14:16.458 --> 14:19.191
I just think she's
really plain-looking.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.761
She kind of annoys me.

14:20.803 --> 14:22.266
You know who's really beautiful?

14:22.300 --> 14:23.403
Joan Allen.

14:23.437 --> 14:25.306
Yes!
Uh, stunning.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.369
Yeah, uh... I-I think, um...

14:28.411 --> 14:30.377
Um, I'm maybe gonna
go use the restroom

14:30.411 --> 14:32.105
and let you guys talk about

14:32.147 --> 14:33.777
whatever you're gonna
talk about.

14:37.654 --> 14:40.055
Huh, I guess Peter made
it to the bathroom,

14:40.089 --> 14:41.896
'cause I can't feel
him walking anymore.

14:41.930 --> 14:42.930
I know.

14:42.931 --> 14:45.435
"Fee-Fi-fo-fum!"
Right?

14:49.035 --> 14:51.306
And what about
those drugstore glasses?

14:51.340 --> 14:53.410
These aren't drugstore glasses,

14:53.445 --> 14:55.739
they came from
a doctor Halloween costume.

14:57.149 --> 14:58.747
Lois was right.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.912
They are making fun of me
behind my back.

15:00.946 --> 15:03.143
They're like a nasty wolf pack.

15:03.185 --> 15:05.149
Hey, man,
just a heads-up:

15:05.183 --> 15:07.011
instead of howling
at the moon tonight,

15:07.045 --> 15:09.744
we're all gonna yell
"cock-a-doodle-doo!"

15:09.778 --> 15:10.778
Really?

15:10.783 --> 15:12.106
That seems weird.

15:12.148 --> 15:14.677
I'm just trying to make sure
you don't look silly.

15:18.873 --> 15:20.742
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

15:23.007 --> 15:23.971
What an idiot!

15:24.005 --> 15:25.410
He actually believed me!

15:25.444 --> 15:28.070
That's what a rooster says, not
a wolf!

15:31.281 --> 15:33.512
Hi, Daddy!
How was howling at the moon?

15:33.546 --> 15:35.446
Shut up!
Why aren't you asleep?

15:35.480 --> 15:36.917
Why isn't he asleep?

15:36.951 --> 15:37.916
Leave him alone!

15:37.950 --> 15:39.612
Have you been
drinking again, Phil?

15:39.654 --> 15:40.979
That's none of
your business!

15:41.021 --> 15:42.282
I never wanted a cub!

15:42.316 --> 15:43.316
Get out!

15:43.355 --> 15:45.987
Get out now
and don't ever come back!

15:48.326 --> 15:51.394
Hey, buddy,
want to get high?

15:56.127 --> 15:57.828
Oh, my God. Phil?

15:57.862 --> 15:59.892
Hey... Robert.

15:59.926 --> 16:00.932
Wow.

16:00.966 --> 16:04.162
Ah, hey,
listen, man...

16:04.196 --> 16:06.033
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

16:16.705 --> 16:18.943
"Cock-a-doodle-doo"
is a passion project

16:18.977 --> 16:20.709
I'd been mulling over for years,

16:20.743 --> 16:23.509
and when<i> Family Guy</i> gave me
the opportunity to shoot it,

16:23.543 --> 16:25.445
I knew there was only one actor

16:25.479 --> 16:28.515
who could portray
Phil the Wolf: Glenn Quagmire.

16:28.549 --> 16:31.344
Peter gave me a beer that tasted
funny, and when I woke up,

16:31.386 --> 16:33.616
I was wearing lipstick
and a wolf suit.

16:37.553 --> 16:39.552
Lois, you were right.

16:39.594 --> 16:41.490
Those women
were talking about me.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.259
Oh, dear.
What did they say?

16:43.301 --> 16:45.468
I don't even remember,
there was such a long cutaway,

16:45.502 --> 16:47.005
but I know it was really mean.

16:47.039 --> 16:48.871
Oh, I'm so
sorry, Peter.

16:48.905 --> 16:50.271
So what do I do now?

16:50.305 --> 16:52.942
Confront them face-to-face
and explain why I'm angry?

16:52.976 --> 16:54.374
Of course not.

16:54.416 --> 16:57.278
Being friends with women is
way more complex than that.

16:57.312 --> 16:59.678
You need to be more
underhanded and vicious.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.252
You and I will get revenge
on those bitches lady-style.

17:03.286 --> 17:04.251
Really?

17:04.285 --> 17:05.683
We'll-we'll do it together?

17:05.717 --> 17:07.051
Yeah, it'll be fun.

17:07.084 --> 17:09.817
Like when we watched
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i> together.

17:09.859 --> 17:12.024
Now, which Cylon is that?

17:12.058 --> 17:13.320
Ah, I-I don't know.

17:13.362 --> 17:14.455
I think it's Number Six.

17:14.489 --> 17:15.991
Wait, i-is that
the same Number Six

17:16.025 --> 17:17.791
that had sex with Dr. Baltar?

17:17.825 --> 17:19.327
I don't... I've been...
I've been watching this

17:19.361 --> 17:21.327
the same exact amount
of time you have, Lois.

17:21.369 --> 17:22.631
I don't know
anything you don't.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.069
Ooh, what does that green button
on the far panel do?

17:25.103 --> 17:26.837
How in God's name
would I know that?!

17:26.872 --> 17:28.669
I don't know!

17:28.703 --> 17:32.170
It's green, so it probably
makes something go.

17:35.042 --> 17:36.042
Hello?

17:36.073 --> 17:37.101
Peter, where are you?

17:37.135 --> 17:38.655
I thought we were gonna
go after Becca.

17:38.670 --> 17:40.970
Way ahead of you, Lois.
I just cut her brakes.

17:41.004 --> 17:42.242
What?!

17:42.276 --> 17:44.009
Don't you think
that's a little dangerous?

17:44.043 --> 17:46.440
Hey, you're the one who said we
should try to ruin her marriage.

17:46.474 --> 17:48.975
She bangs up her car,
her husband's gonna be furious.

17:50.010 --> 17:50.975
What was that?

17:51.009 --> 17:52.446
Oh, I-I just ran a red light.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.080
My car won't slow down
for some reason.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.882
Anyway, this is
gonna be awesome.

17:55.924 --> 17:57.857
Geez, I'm going, like, 95.

17:57.891 --> 18:00.190
Peter, are you sure
you didn't cut<i> your</i> brakes?

18:00.224 --> 18:02.054
That's ridiculous.
Why would I cut my own...

18:02.088 --> 18:03.886
Kids, get out of the way!
I can't stop!

18:07.790 --> 18:09.524
All right, Peter,
next is Jamie.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.729
Now, what's the most
important thing in her life?

18:11.763 --> 18:12.763
Oh, that's easy.

18:12.794 --> 18:14.624
Her daughter Emily
is a competitive diver.

18:14.666 --> 18:15.929
The whole family's dream

18:15.963 --> 18:18.369
is that she gets a spot
on the U.S. Olympic Team.

18:18.403 --> 18:21.670
Okay, so get a lead pipe and
bust this girl's kneecaps.

18:21.704 --> 18:22.870
No, no, no, Lois.

18:22.904 --> 18:24.670
That's not how
we're gonna do this.

19:26.046 --> 19:28.350
That's how we're

19:34.023 --> 19:35.725
Okay, next is Karen.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.096
Now, she's been planning her
daughter's wedding for a year.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.729
If it doesn't go perfectly,
she'll be crushed.

19:40.763 --> 19:41.864
Already on it, Lois.

19:41.898 --> 19:43.567
I bribed one of
the busboys.

19:43.601 --> 19:45.966
He has a little surprise
planned for her.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.206
Oh, my God!
Somebody stabbed the groom!

19:54.281 --> 19:56.941
Oh, no,
it's not a perfect day.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.286
Well, we got those
bitches good, huh, Peter?

20:01.320 --> 20:02.814
Yeah, thanks, Lois.

20:02.856 --> 20:04.023
And you were right.

20:04.057 --> 20:06.055
Being friends with women
is way too complicated

20:06.089 --> 20:07.520
and way too
intense for me.

20:07.562 --> 20:10.624
Now let me just pay the busboy
and we can get out of here.

20:10.666 --> 20:13.694
Ah! I knew he didn't
understand the plan!

20:19.338 --> 20:21.207
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Peter.

20:21.242 --> 20:25.238
Look, I-I'm real sorry
I got so worked up at my roast.

20:25.273 --> 20:27.007
And if you're willing,

20:27.041 --> 20:29.248
I'd like to be friends
with you guys again.

20:29.282 --> 20:31.479
Because men might
punch you in the gut

20:31.513 --> 20:32.845
and call you a fat idiot,

20:32.879 --> 20:35.244
but at least they do it
to your face and own it.

20:35.286 --> 20:36.778
You were mad at us?

20:36.820 --> 20:38.345
Yeah, we ain't spoke
in a week.

20:38.387 --> 20:39.879
I thought you were out of town.

20:39.913 --> 20:42.779
People come, people go.
I didn't give no mind.

20:42.813 --> 20:45.283
So we're-we're
friends again?

20:45.317 --> 20:46.818
We were never not friends,
you idiot.

20:46.852 --> 20:48.482
I love you guys.

20:48.516 --> 20:49.817
Guys are the best.

20:49.851 --> 20:51.250
Not women.

20:58.756 --> 21:00.723
