Hallmark
Original Pictures presents

00:35.468 --> 00:38.770
an instant family classic:
<i>Summers With My Slow Brother,</i>

00:38.805 --> 00:41.340
starring a cast of people
who make you say "Oh,"

00:41.374 --> 00:43.275
because you didn't think
they were still acting.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.077
For example, Grant Show.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.111
Oh.

00:46.112 --> 00:47.112
Rachael Leigh Cook.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.113
Oh.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.114
David Faustino.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.115
Oh.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.583
And Robin Tunney.
Huh?

00:51.617 --> 00:53.552
The bald-headed chick
from <i>Empire Records.</i>

00:53.586 --> 00:54.653
Oh.

00:54.687 --> 00:55.887
Guys, could you
turn that down?

00:55.888 --> 00:57.656
I'm trying to study
for the SAT.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.990
Hey, careful, Meg.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.692
Remember what happened
the last time I had to choose

01:00.727 --> 01:02.060
between you and the TV.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.529
Don't worry.
Meg's holding our stuff.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.399
Meg, don't drink
that soda!

01:07.433 --> 01:08.700
I'm serious, you guys.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.369
I haven't been doing well
on these practice tests,

01:10.403 --> 01:12.704
and I need to improve my score
to get into a good college.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.406
You're in high school,
sweetie.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.375
You should be much more
concerned about your weight

01:16.409 --> 01:18.043
than your SAT scores.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.211
Don't listen to her, Meg.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.746
Academics are
extremely important.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.714
Are the SATs essential?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.416
Vital? Crucial?

01:24.450 --> 01:26.451
All of the above.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.987
I'll get the scissors
and cut that poop off your bum.

01:29.021 --> 01:30.822
Meg, trust me,
you ace these SATs,

01:30.857 --> 01:32.424
you could go on
to do anything.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.359
You could be a doctor,
an architect.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.695
Hell, you could even coach
the Mighty Ducks.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.864
All right, the championship
is on the line.

01:38.898 --> 01:41.066
It's time for a formation
they're not expecting.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.234
The Flying V?

01:42.268 --> 01:45.203
No. The Stinky V.

01:57.049 --> 01:58.917
Wassup, my sistas?

01:58.951 --> 02:01.887
Ooh, I ain't sat down
in a hot minute!

02:01.921 --> 02:03.822
What the hell? Why are
you talking like that?

02:03.856 --> 02:06.191
Sorry, I have
family in town.

02:06.225 --> 02:07.559
You guys, I'm freaking out.

02:07.593 --> 02:09.161
The SATs are this weekend,

02:09.195 --> 02:11.263
and there's no way
I'm gonna get a good score.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.832
You know, Meg, maybe you should
get someone super smart

02:13.866 --> 02:15.100
to take it for you.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.435
Have someone
take it for me?

02:16.469 --> 02:17.803
But that's cheating.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.905
No one cares about
cheating anymore, Meg.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.740
Not since
Slick Willy Clinton

02:21.774 --> 02:23.708
lowered the nation's
moral standards.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.544
God, give it up, Patty.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.213
I'm just saying, find
someone really smart

02:28.247 --> 02:30.782
to take the SAT for you
in exchange for money.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.552
Did someone say
"Jewish"?

02:33.586 --> 02:35.153
Oh, hey, Neil.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.022
Listen, is there
any chance

02:37.056 --> 02:39.991
you'd be willing to take the
SAT for me this weekend?

02:40.026 --> 02:41.359
Sorry, Meg, I'm swamped.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.462
I'm taking my body
into the shop.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.965
I don't know what you've been
doing to this thing, Neil,

02:46.999 --> 02:48.099
but you see this gunk?

02:48.134 --> 02:49.634
That ain't supposed
to be there.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.336
Well, just do
whatever you can.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.638
All right, I'm gonna go eat
a sandwich with one hand

02:53.673 --> 02:55.941
and fill out the invoice
with the other.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.008
Don't worry, Meg.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.203
There's got to
be someone else

02:58.211 --> 02:59.891
who'd be willing to take
that test for you.

02:59.912 --> 03:00.912
Like who?

03:00.913 --> 03:02.080
You guys are my only friends,

03:02.114 --> 03:03.682
and everyone
in my family's a moron.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.217
What about your
hot mom, Meg?

03:05.251 --> 03:07.385
What?
I said how about your dog? He's smart.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.987
That doesn't sound
like what you said,

03:09.021 --> 03:11.056
but yeah,
Brian is kind of smart.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.425
Maybe I'll get him
to take it for me.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.460
Your mom's so  hot.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.833
We now return to another

03:21.868 --> 03:23.301
Michael Jordan
underwear commercial

03:23.336 --> 03:25.437
on a plane for some reason.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.305
Does your underwear
have tags?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.707
Uh, what?

03:28.741 --> 03:30.809
Uh, Mr. Jordan, you're gonna
have to take your seat

03:30.843 --> 03:33.144
and stop asking people
about their underwear.

03:33.179 --> 03:35.180
Oh, hey, Brian.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.382
I was just thinking
about you.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.417
You know how I've always
loved your novel

03:39.452 --> 03:41.052
<i>Faster Than the</i>
<i>Speed of Love?</i>

03:41.087 --> 03:42.454
Okay, what's this?

03:42.488 --> 03:44.990
She's peanut buttering you up
for something.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.058
No, I-I didn't even know
you'd read my novel.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.294
Oh, yeah. I'm a huge
fan of "FATSPOL."

03:49.328 --> 03:52.230
That's the acronym I use for
<i>Faster Than the Speed of Love,</i>

03:52.265 --> 03:53.798
because I mention
it so much.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.534
God, that would've
saved me years.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.502
Anyway, I was just rereading

03:57.537 --> 03:59.404
my favorite passage
the other day.

03:59.438 --> 04:02.774
"The weight of the gun
in Jason's hand surprised him.

04:02.808 --> 04:06.011
'How heavy,' he wondered,
'is the human soul?'"

04:06.045 --> 04:07.078
That's page one.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.513
She's quoting page one.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.981
Your book is genius, Brian.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.318
I can't believe Amazon
is dumping it for 99 cents.

04:13.352 --> 04:14.753
What?! My book is on Amazon?!

04:14.787 --> 04:15.921
Oh, yeah, Brian,

04:15.955 --> 04:17.989
there's something
for everyone on Amazon.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.998
In fact,
you're so smart,

04:27.033 --> 04:29.834
I thought you'd be
the perfect person

04:29.869 --> 04:32.237
to maybe take
the SAT for me.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.272
What? But that would be wrong.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.575
Well, I suppose you may
look at it that way.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.778
But a wise book once said,
"With the heart at stake,

04:39.812 --> 04:42.881
right and wrong is
a stake through the heart."

04:42.915 --> 04:44.049
That one's on the cover.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.218
Wow, ensnared by
my own verbal trap.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.321
Well played, me, through you.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.890
All right, Meg,
I'll take that test for you.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.325
I guess what I'm saying is,

04:53.359 --> 04:56.695
"Ace Pilotson,
reporting for World War Love."

04:56.729 --> 04:58.430
What?
She didn't read  the book, Bri.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.664
That's your
main character.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.666
Don't worry, Meg--
I'm always here to help.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.269
Like a 1960s British policeman.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.204
Officer! Me child's
been kidnapped!

05:06.238 --> 05:08.540
Calm down, ma'am, it's
all under control.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.308
I've got a whistle,
a cloth helmet,

05:10.343 --> 05:12.911
a key to a call box, a
soft rubber truncheon,

05:12.945 --> 05:14.980
and a map of the city.
Please hurry!

05:15.014 --> 05:16.615
I don't much
like your tone.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.385
That's a tiny pencil-and-pad
citation for you!

05:25.491 --> 05:27.559
Okay, Bria you can do this.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.864
Hey, Meg.
Hi, Meg.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.899
Hey, how's it going?

05:38.070 --> 05:39.704
<i>My</i> locker.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.907
Meg, I thought we were
gonna try to work on that.

05:47.079 --> 05:48.780
Hey, other teens,

05:48.814 --> 05:51.049
how about our youth culture,
am I right?

05:51.083 --> 05:52.917
All the new hairs we're getting.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.153
Hey, hashtag SATs, huh?

05:55.187 --> 05:56.655
Yeah, I guess.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.423
Wow, I can't believe
this worked.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.692
I was afraid I'd stick out,
like the one guy

06:00.726 --> 06:02.927
in Lincoln's cabinet
who didn't have a beard.

06:02.962 --> 06:06.364
I want to win this war,
and I want to do it fast. Ideas?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.299
We should meet the rebels
head-on in Virginia.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.869
Yes, and use our ships
to block their supply chains.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.737
We could also use
our troop advantage

06:12.772 --> 06:14.472
to out-flank them
in the west.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.941
Uh, what did that
baby just say?

06:16.976 --> 06:19.644
All right, cell phones away,
eyes on your own paper,

06:19.679 --> 06:22.480
and before we start,
who's giving me a ride home?

06:22.515 --> 06:24.582
Not you, a girl.

06:26.118 --> 06:27.686
For luck, Meg.

06:29.121 --> 06:31.423
We're all rooting for ya.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.595
We now return to <i>Malcolm XXY.</i>

06:37.630 --> 06:39.097
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock!

06:39.131 --> 06:40.298
Yeah!

06:40.332 --> 06:42.434
Plymouth Rock gave us
both sets of genitals!

06:42.468 --> 06:44.169
- Yeah!
- What?

06:44.203 --> 06:45.603
Mail's here.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.439
I got my SAT scores.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.640
So, how'd we do?

06:48.674 --> 06:50.642
"We" scored a thousand.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.678
Nice! One thousand,
on the nose.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.847
Boop! You are welcome.

06:55.881 --> 06:59.751
Brian, that's a thousand
out of a possible 2,400!

06:59.785 --> 07:02.120
That's the worst score
in my class!

07:02.154 --> 07:03.354
What?!
Damn it,

07:03.389 --> 07:05.423
why did I ever think
you were smart?

07:05.458 --> 07:08.059
That's... that's not possible.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.794
Ha-ha! Brian's stupid!

07:09.829 --> 07:12.030
I must alert
the townsfolk!

07:13.199 --> 07:16.367
Hyah! Fly, Artemis, fly!

07:16.402 --> 07:18.436
Hark, townsfolk!

07:18.471 --> 07:20.205
Brian, uh...

07:20.239 --> 07:22.907
he... oh, damn,
what was it?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.042
Brian...

07:24.076 --> 07:26.311
Brian goes to college?
No.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.379
Brian gets
another book published?

07:28.414 --> 07:30.515
Y-Yeah. Yeah,
maybe that's it.

07:30.549 --> 07:34.652
Tell all that Brian's getting
another book published!

07:34.687 --> 07:35.920
Oh, thank God!

07:35.955 --> 07:38.690
I thought it was gonna be
a Meg episode all throughout.

07:44.276 --> 07:46.845
I got the lowest score
in Meg's class?

07:46.879 --> 07:48.580
How could this happen?

07:48.614 --> 07:50.982
Face it, Brian,
this proves that you're stupid.

07:51.016 --> 07:53.418
Proves it empirically.

07:53.452 --> 07:55.620
That means it's verified.
I know!

07:55.654 --> 07:57.689
I just weirdly woke up
in the laundry room.

07:57.723 --> 07:59.958
Not now, Peter!
Geez, what's wrong with you?

07:59.992 --> 08:03.661
Brian took the SAT for Meg,
and it turns out he's an idiot.

08:03.696 --> 08:05.096
That's not true!

08:05.131 --> 08:06.931
Methinks the Hoff
protest a month.

08:06.966 --> 08:09.100
Do you even know what
you're trying to say?

08:09.135 --> 08:11.536
Hey, look, don't feel bad,
Brian-- it's fun being stupid.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.204
You don't got to
worry about nothing,

08:13.239 --> 08:15.640
you don't got to read books,
and you never die.

08:15.674 --> 08:17.142
Peter, that...
that's not correct.

08:17.176 --> 08:18.576
How would you
know, stupid?

08:20.279 --> 08:22.013
Thanks a lot, SAT.

08:22.047 --> 08:24.449
Man, this is
the worst day of my life.

08:24.483 --> 08:26.518
Empirically.
Eh, careful.

08:26.552 --> 08:28.386
Brian, being a dumb
guy's not so awful.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.889
I'll show you. Come on, you're
spending the day with me.

08:30.923 --> 08:33.358
Here, you want a beer?
Peter, it's 11:00 a.m.

08:33.392 --> 08:35.727
If the clock ain't digital,
you don't know that.

08:35.761 --> 08:38.163
Well, actually,
I could use a drink.

08:38.197 --> 08:39.831
There you go! You look
stupider already.

08:39.865 --> 08:41.432
Let's go.
Where are we going?

08:41.467 --> 08:42.901
Who cares?
Now, come on,

08:42.935 --> 08:45.470
we're gonna party like
it's the Roaring Twenties.

Why are you laughing?

'Cause it's funny! What, do you
think you're better than me?

09:23.309 --> 09:25.410
By the way, a huge part
of being an idiot

they're shooting T-shirts

09:53.706 --> 09:56.207
Oh, those aren't T-shirts.
Thems is hot dogs.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.377
Huh. That's
kind of cool.

09:59.411 --> 10:00.678
I want a hot dog.

10:00.713 --> 10:03.081
Well, then you better
move quick-- he's reloading!

10:07.853 --> 10:09.821

Hey, you feel good
about yourself, jagoff?

10:11.890 --> 10:14.492
Yeah, that's right-- I knocked
your kid over to get a hot dog.

10:16.161 --> 10:17.528

10:17.563 --> 10:18.796
You think you're
better than me?!

10:18.831 --> 10:21.666
Ah, look at you, Brian,
right at home with us dumb guys.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.736
You're blending in better than
a centipede among millipedes.

10:24.770 --> 10:26.504
Well, what should
we do today?

10:26.538 --> 10:28.172

Hey, yo, Stew.
My boy Peter and I

11:50.889 --> 11:52.824
are watching the Sandler movie
<i>That's My Boy.</i>

11:52.858 --> 11:54.392
You gotta come
check it out, man.

11:54.426 --> 11:55.660
It's amazeballs.

11:55.694 --> 11:57.628
This is just
the DVD menu.

12:00.366 --> 12:01.532
No way.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.534
Aw, man, I am
buzzin' hardcore

12:03.569 --> 12:05.169
off of that chaw, man.

12:05.204 --> 12:06.304
Brian, what
the deuce?

12:06.338 --> 12:08.039
Deuce.

12:08.073 --> 12:09.774
Like poo.
Yes, yes, deuce like poo.

12:09.808 --> 12:11.242
But what the devil
has happened to you?

12:11.276 --> 12:13.244
Uh, I woke up, Kemosabe?

12:13.278 --> 12:15.880
No, I mean it. How
could one bad test score

12:15.914 --> 12:17.915
transform you into
a complete moron?

12:17.950 --> 12:20.251
Brian, I'm concerned something
is very wrong with you.

12:20.285 --> 12:22.520
Nah, man, I've never
felt better, Beef Stew.

12:22.554 --> 12:23.721
Bazinga!

12:23.756 --> 12:26.057
Like what
the gay scientist says.

12:26.091 --> 12:28.192
Hey, Brian,
say something else from TV.

12:28.227 --> 12:30.228
What you talkin' 'bout,
Phyllis?!

12:34.333 --> 12:36.401
Aw, gross,
he's getting his nose period.

12:36.435 --> 12:38.336
Oh, my God! We've got
to get him to a hospital!

12:38.370 --> 12:39.690
Don't worry, Brian,
I'll save you.

12:39.705 --> 12:40.838
I'm good in a crisis.

12:40.873 --> 12:43.307
After all, I used to work
the suicide hotline.

12:43.342 --> 12:45.843
I-I just can't take it.

12:45.878 --> 12:49.347
I discovered my wife's
been cheating on me for a while.

12:49.381 --> 12:51.149
And I just...

12:51.183 --> 12:54.852
I can't live like this.

12:54.887 --> 12:57.855
I have to kill myself.

12:57.890 --> 13:01.225
Doesn't it make more sense
to kill her?

13:04.663 --> 13:06.663
Brian, the good news is
we've stopped the bleeding.

13:06.665 --> 13:08.433
And we've removed
the Matchbox car

13:08.467 --> 13:09.967
that was lodged
in your rectum.

13:10.002 --> 13:11.636
I did that right
after you passed out.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.839
Classic P-Dog.

13:14.873 --> 13:17.175
But, Dr. Hartman,
why did he lose consciousness?

13:17.209 --> 13:19.644
Well, keeping in mind the
recent behavioral changes

13:19.678 --> 13:21.779
you've described,
I did a CAT scan...

13:21.814 --> 13:22.980
On a dog.

13:23.015 --> 13:24.515
We laughed about
that, too.

13:24.550 --> 13:28.419
However, I'm sorry to inform you
that Brian has a brain tumor.

13:29.588 --> 13:31.022
Oh, my God.

13:31.056 --> 13:32.623
There's only one thing to do:

13:32.658 --> 13:35.827
shrink down to microscopic size,
enter Brian's brain,

13:35.861 --> 13:38.696
and destroy the tumor
from within.

13:41.066 --> 13:43.067
I was raped by a bug.

13:46.965 --> 13:49.433
Brain tumor. How
is that possible?

13:49.468 --> 13:51.769
As a father in a hospital
getting bad news,

13:51.803 --> 13:55.273
I am gonna sadly slide down
the wall and take my hat off.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.344
I forgot the hat.

14:00.379 --> 14:03.614
So, Doc, w... um, how much
Jamba Juice do I have to drink

14:03.649 --> 14:05.149
to cure this?
Um...

14:05.183 --> 14:07.985
I-I've also heard that,
like, crystals exist?

14:08.020 --> 14:10.655
Dr. Hartman, do you think
the brain tumor might explain

14:10.689 --> 14:12.857
why Brian's been acting
so odd lately?

14:12.891 --> 14:16.027
Hmm, well, I haven't heard of
brains being linked to behavior,

14:16.061 --> 14:17.695
but I suppose
anything is possible.

14:17.729 --> 14:19.897
Mom, is Dad gonna die?

14:19.931 --> 14:22.333
No, Chris, Brian is the one
with the brain tumor.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.302
Dr. Hartman,
what's the prognosis?

14:24.336 --> 14:27.571
Well, it says here Brian's
tumor is for office use only.

14:27.606 --> 14:30.541
Benign. It says "benign."

14:30.575 --> 14:32.877
Oh, Brian, that's wonderful
news! You're going to be okay!

14:32.911 --> 14:34.512
Winning!

14:34.546 --> 14:36.480
Remember
somebody said that?

14:36.515 --> 14:39.016
Well, since Brian's tumor poses
no immediate threat,

14:39.051 --> 14:40.885
we can schedule surgery
to remove it,

14:40.919 --> 14:43.287
and he'll be back
to his old self in no time.

14:43.322 --> 14:45.322
Well, I say we get that tumor
out of him right away

14:45.324 --> 14:47.024
before he gets any dumber.
No way.

14:47.059 --> 14:48.693
I'm never going back
to my old self.

14:48.727 --> 14:50.695
I rock like this.
I'm legit.

14:50.729 --> 14:52.897
I'm uber.
I'm awesome-sauce.

14:52.931 --> 14:55.366
Either take the tumor out of him
or put one in me!

14:55.400 --> 14:56.567
I can't stand this!

14:56.601 --> 14:58.502
So i-if Brian doesn't have
the surgery,

14:58.537 --> 15:00.037
will he be all right?

15:00.072 --> 15:02.206
I don't know. Is
Dax Shepard all right?

15:02.240 --> 15:04.475
Eh, seems kind
of gratuitous.

15:04.509 --> 15:07.411
My point is, Brian could have
the surgery and be smart again,

15:07.446 --> 15:09.947
or he could skip the surgery
and stay dumb like this.

15:09.981 --> 15:12.616
Well, Brian,
if-if you're happy this way...

15:12.651 --> 15:14.485
Hells to the yeah,
I am!

15:14.519 --> 15:16.487
Hey, um, I was told
there would be a lollipop

15:16.521 --> 15:18.022
at the end of this?

15:18.056 --> 15:19.890
Good, he doesn't know
about the stickers.

15:19.925 --> 15:21.225
I'll take two.

15:21.259 --> 15:22.893
Brian, you're not thinking
clearly, all right?

15:22.928 --> 15:24.729
You've got to agree
to this surgery.

15:24.763 --> 15:27.164
Because right now, you're
as useless as Black Widow is

15:27.199 --> 15:28.532
to the Avengers.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.568
So... what's
your superpower?

15:30.602 --> 15:31.902
Kicking.

15:31.937 --> 15:33.804
Oh, right, 'cause
none of us can kick.

15:33.839 --> 15:36.907
Hey, which one
of you guys can kick?

15:36.942 --> 15:38.943
Hulk, stop being nice.

15:38.977 --> 15:40.745
Sorry.

15:45.751 --> 15:49.587
Hey, this isn't the
Kenny Chesney concert.

15:49.621 --> 15:52.390
No, I'm afraid that was a white
lie to get you here, Brian.

15:52.424 --> 15:54.892
This is the opera.
I'm hoping that re-exposing you

15:54.926 --> 15:58.562
to high culture will remind you
of the joys of a refined mind.

15:58.597 --> 16:01.232
Cool. I'm sitting on my
foot to hold in a dump.

16:01.266 --> 16:03.200
Please don't
embarrass me here.

16:03.235 --> 16:06.237
Pepperoni pie,
extra cheese. G32.

16:06.271 --> 16:07.905
Oh, cool.
My friend Pete is here.

16:07.939 --> 16:09.640
Pete Za.

16:09.674 --> 16:12.376
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. That's
gonna be me in, like, a minute.

16:12.411 --> 16:13.544
Over here, bro!

16:13.578 --> 16:16.247
Aw, I moved my foot.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.351
Hey, this isn't
the Kenny Chesney concert.

16:20.385 --> 16:22.686
No, Brian,
this is called yoga.

16:22.721 --> 16:25.222
Lots of smart people do it
instead of going to church.

16:25.257 --> 16:27.758
And after we get done with this,
you're going to talk a lot

16:27.793 --> 16:29.760
about being present
and grounded.

16:29.795 --> 16:31.562
You're going to be
impossible to be around.

16:31.596 --> 16:33.597
Let's get started.

16:34.599 --> 16:36.534
Whoa! Schwing!

16:36.568 --> 16:40.671
Schwing! Schwing!
Schwing! Schwing!

16:41.740 --> 16:43.040
That was from
<i>Wayne's World.</i>

16:43.074 --> 16:45.443
That's the sound
of Wayne's boner.

16:49.648 --> 16:51.115
Okay, before
you say anything, no,

16:51.149 --> 16:52.983
this is not
the Kenny Chesney concert.

16:53.018 --> 16:55.786
We're here to have a nice
civilized dinner and to show you

16:55.821 --> 16:57.955
that you don't have to eat
all your meals in your car.

16:57.989 --> 16:59.457
Now, we're going to start
by hearing the waiter

16:59.491 --> 17:00.958
give us the specials.

17:00.992 --> 17:04.028
Good evening. Our first special
is an almond-crusted salmon...

17:04.062 --> 17:05.896
Hey, cram it, skinny.
Give me free food

17:05.931 --> 17:08.899
or I'm gonna tell people on Yelp
there was a pube in my salad.

17:08.934 --> 17:10.301
Free food,
right away.

17:10.335 --> 17:11.469
Okay. All right.

17:11.503 --> 17:13.471
I forgot that Yelp
is a weapon for dumb people.

17:13.505 --> 17:15.139
You taught me something
today, Bri.

17:15.173 --> 17:17.475
That I can throw
a frog a hundred feet?

17:17.509 --> 17:19.310
I can't change you back.

17:19.344 --> 17:21.645
This whole endeavor
was doomed to fail.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.114
Like an Asian guy
going to a salon.

17:24.149 --> 17:27.418
Hi. I want to have
my anus breached.

17:30.922 --> 17:32.423
He's gone, Rupert.

17:32.457 --> 17:34.758
It appears I've lost
Brian to the dumb side.

17:34.793 --> 17:37.294
So now I need you
to be Brian.

17:37.329 --> 17:39.363
Here's your collar.
And here's a laptop.

17:39.397 --> 17:41.432
Write something bad.

17:43.435 --> 17:45.336
"It was the last
day of summer

17:45.370 --> 17:47.872
and the first day of
the rest of her life."

17:47.906 --> 17:50.341
Wow! You did that
with your face!

17:50.375 --> 17:53.010
Hey, what's this?
Gaylord practice?

17:53.044 --> 17:55.379
That's the eighth time
you've asked me that today.

17:55.413 --> 17:57.281
Listen, Brian, I've been trying
to change you.

17:57.315 --> 17:59.783
But I realize
that if you're happy,

17:59.818 --> 18:02.520
I need to accept the you
that you want to be.

18:02.554 --> 18:04.255
No matter how painful that is.

18:04.289 --> 18:05.756
What are you doing?

18:05.790 --> 18:08.626
Oh, my friend Terry told me you
can get high from licking paint.

18:08.660 --> 18:09.660
Who's Terry?

18:09.661 --> 18:10.661
He's friends
with Gus.

18:10.662 --> 18:11.662
Who's Gus?

18:11.663 --> 18:13.063
Um, Gus is
Terry's friend.

18:13.098 --> 18:14.698
It... You kind of
had to be there.

18:14.733 --> 18:17.034
For what?
No story has been told!

18:17.068 --> 18:20.037
Okay, well, I'm gonna go put on
my python and walk to the park.

18:20.071 --> 18:21.639
Brian, wait. I'm...

18:21.673 --> 18:25.276
I'm trying to say that I accept
your choice to forego surgery.

18:25.310 --> 18:28.479
I release you into
the thick mire of stupidity.

18:28.513 --> 18:30.481
Hey, Brian, I started
the car in the garage

18:30.515 --> 18:31.815
and it's all
foggy in there.

18:31.850 --> 18:33.250
Want to go pretend
we're in London?

18:33.285 --> 18:35.719
Oh, totally!
Shrimp on the barbie, huh?

18:35.754 --> 18:38.489
Yes!

18:38.523 --> 18:40.357
Good Lord,
if I don't do something,

18:40.392 --> 18:41.825
his stupidity will kill him.

18:41.860 --> 18:43.761
And then I'd lose Brian forever.

18:43.795 --> 18:46.664
Like that dog
the Russians shot into space.

18:51.503 --> 18:53.470
He made it! Your
dog is in orbit!

18:53.505 --> 18:56.473
Is wonderful.
How do we get him back now?

18:56.508 --> 18:58.475
Oh... about that.

18:58.510 --> 18:59.810
We do not.

18:59.844 --> 19:03.180
Oh, my poor dog.
He will die up there.

19:10.188 --> 19:12.823
Joke on them!
I find happy dog planet.

19:12.857 --> 19:16.093
In 50 years, we all go back
to Earth and bite everybody.

19:16.127 --> 19:17.428
But now we dance!

19:21.933 --> 19:24.034
I've got to convince him
to get that tumor removed

19:24.069 --> 19:25.736
before it's too late.

19:27.606 --> 19:31.008
Now, remember, it's England,
so take long deep breaths.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.343
Wait a second.

19:32.377 --> 19:34.411
I've been approaching this
far too intelligently.

19:34.446 --> 19:36.914
He's an idiot,
so this won't be hard at all.

19:36.948 --> 19:39.249
Hey, Brian, you want
to go see Dr. Hartman

19:39.284 --> 19:41.585
and get that procedure
where you get two wieners?

19:41.620 --> 19:43.387
Whoa! Hell yeah!

19:43.421 --> 19:45.723
That way, when I watch
<i>Black Swan,</i> I can aim one

19:45.757 --> 19:47.858
at Natalie Portman
and aim the other at...

19:47.892 --> 19:50.728
Yes, yes, yes, we all know
who the other one was. Let's go.

19:53.565 --> 19:56.533
Well, good news, Griffins:
Brian is gonna be just fine.

19:56.568 --> 19:58.535
I was able
to remove his tumor.

19:58.570 --> 20:01.405
And if anyone wants to keep it,
it's here in this Tupperware.

20:01.439 --> 20:03.674
This-this is half
of a chicken cutlet.

20:03.708 --> 20:06.510
Oh, boy.
What did I have for lunch?

20:06.544 --> 20:08.946
Oh, Brian, I'm so glad
you're all right.

20:08.980 --> 20:11.949
Thanks. But this is
all kind of surreal.

20:11.983 --> 20:14.118
I mean,
being in this hospital bed,

20:14.152 --> 20:17.121
I-I feel like the main character
of <i>As I Lay Dying</i>

20:17.155 --> 20:18.789
as he or she lay dying.

20:18.823 --> 20:21.792
Oh, that's just the amount of
superficial quasi-knowledge

20:21.826 --> 20:23.227
the old Brian had.

20:23.261 --> 20:24.561
I missed you, buddy.

20:24.596 --> 20:26.230
Welcome back.

20:26.264 --> 20:27.264
Thanks, Stewie.

20:27.265 --> 20:28.732
You never gave up on me.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.634
You knew that wasn't really me.

20:30.669 --> 20:31.769
Yeah, well,
it's no big...

20:31.803 --> 20:33.937
I mean, I was having fun,
making new friends,

20:33.972 --> 20:36.206
getting laid all the time,
sleeping like a rock,

20:36.241 --> 20:37.675
but you made the call.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.010
You unilaterally decided
I was better off

20:40.045 --> 20:43.681
a bitter alcoholic failure who
can only hang out with a baby.

20:43.715 --> 20:45.683
Hey. We have fun.

20:46.118 --> 20:47.108
Hey, Lois, guess what.

20:47.109 --> 20:49.212
I had them do
that two-wiener operation on me.

20:49.212 --> 20:52.968
- You what?!
- Double trouble.

20:52.969 --> 20:55.384
Uh-oh. That was the original.
