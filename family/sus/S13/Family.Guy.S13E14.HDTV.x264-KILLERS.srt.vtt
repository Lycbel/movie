== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

00:34.143 --> 00:37.210
Say, you fellas know
if Jerome serves dessert here?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.912
I got a real hankering
for pudding.

00:38.948 --> 00:40.347
That's so weird.

00:40.382 --> 00:42.816
I was just thinking about
pudding on the way over here.

00:42.851 --> 00:44.618
Okay, well,
you two are clearly in love,

00:44.653 --> 00:46.186
but I could also go
for some pudding.

00:46.221 --> 00:47.654
Why we all got pudding
on the brain?

00:47.690 --> 00:48.922
It's got to be
that new billboard

00:48.958 --> 00:50.891
advertising pudding
on the highway.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.492
We all drove past it
on the way here.

00:52.528 --> 00:53.994
Huh.
Well, that's no surprise.

00:54.029 --> 00:56.163
Everyone in my house
can get very excited

00:56.198 --> 00:58.098
by a good ad campaign.

01:08.344 --> 01:10.043
Lois! Lois, it's back!

01:10.079 --> 01:12.079
I heard, Peter!
I heard!

01:12.114 --> 01:13.480
Kids, kids, it's happening!

01:13.515 --> 01:15.549
Get your coats!
This is what we practiced for!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.419
I love you, Dad!

01:19.455 --> 01:20.587
I love you, too, sweetheart!

01:20.623 --> 01:22.589
None of the past matters!

01:22.625 --> 01:24.825
Oh, yeah, I seen
that pudding billboard.

01:24.860 --> 01:28.428
It's that one that says
"CBS Outdoor Advertising" on it.

01:28.464 --> 01:31.698
Yeah, but right above that is,
like, a big guy eating pudding.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.000
I don't remember none of that.

01:33.035 --> 01:35.268
I just remember
"CBS Outdoor Advertising"

01:35.304 --> 01:37.971
on the bottom and three pigeons
sitting on top.

01:38.007 --> 01:40.173
You're bad at looking
at billboards.

01:40.209 --> 01:41.708
Hey, we should go
check it out right now.

01:41.744 --> 01:44.444
Ordinarily I'd say no, but
that adult kickball league

01:44.480 --> 01:46.947
is coming in for drinks,
so let's get out of here.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.782
Guys, check it out.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.451
I've got flip-up shades
on my flip-up shades.

01:51.487 --> 01:53.420
Dude, you are the worst.

01:53.455 --> 01:56.590
Hey, we're all the worst.

02:03.232 --> 02:04.731
That's real
pudding in there.

02:04.767 --> 02:06.066
What? No, it isn't.

02:06.101 --> 02:09.036
They wouldn't put real pudding
on a billboard, Peter.

02:09.071 --> 02:11.438
Do you have any idea how
crippled you sound right now?

02:11.473 --> 02:12.973
Peter, it's not real pudding.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.242
God, sometimes I just want
to shake some sense into you.

02:15.277 --> 02:17.477
Big talk for a guy
who looks like a dad

02:17.513 --> 02:19.079
at a Dave Matthews'
concert.

02:19.114 --> 02:21.048
Everybody hates how
you dress, right, Joe?

02:21.083 --> 02:23.450
Sorry, I stay out
of fashion debates.

02:23.485 --> 02:25.619
I've been burned
one too many times.

02:25.654 --> 02:27.988
Hey, guys,
notice anything different?

02:28.023 --> 02:29.956
Yeah, Minetti's got
a hot new look.

02:29.992 --> 02:32.693
The whole thing,
it just works.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.728
Minetti.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.496
Look, there's only one
way to settle this.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.199
I am climbing that billboard
to prove it's real pudding.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.171
Moisturizer?

02:44.206 --> 02:46.206
Sure.
Okay.

02:48.177 --> 02:51.311
We getting on
into the chappy season.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.882
Peter, be careful
up there!

02:55.918 --> 02:58.185
Is this being
careful enough, Joe?

02:58.220 --> 03:00.053
Okay. All right.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.559
Peter, are you okay?!

03:05.594 --> 03:08.195
All right, there's no pudding,
but there is a kid up here.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.696
Don't hold him like that.

03:09.732 --> 03:10.864
Oh, my God!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.733
Peter, that's the lost
Nicholson kid!

03:12.768 --> 03:14.501
He's been missing for a week!

03:14.536 --> 03:16.036
Oh, yeah.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.605
They arrested a
custodian 'cause of you.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.874
Peter, stay put.
I'll call this in,

03:20.909 --> 03:23.443
and we'll get a crew
out here to help you both down.

03:23.479 --> 03:24.945
All right,
but can you hurry it up?

03:24.980 --> 03:26.613
I got band practice later.

03:28.117 --> 03:29.616
<i>I love playing the maracas.</i>

03:29.651 --> 03:30.851
<i>They're so fun.</i>

03:30.886 --> 03:32.219
<i>I wonder what's in them.</i>

03:32.254 --> 03:35.088
<i>Sand or rice probably.</i>

03:35.124 --> 03:36.723
<i>Maybe it's little shells.</i>

03:36.759 --> 03:39.059
<i>Oh, no, what if it's bones?</i>

03:39.094 --> 03:40.594
<i>No, no, bones are too big.</i>

03:40.629 --> 03:42.863
<i>But baby bones aren't.</i>

03:42.898 --> 03:45.799
<i>No, no, no, nobody would kill</i>
<i>a bunch of babies for maracas.</i>

03:45.834 --> 03:47.901
<i>How would you kill</i>
<i>all those babies anyway?</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:50.570
<i>I'd probably put them in a tub.</i>

03:50.606 --> 03:52.773
<i>You could kill, like,</i>
<i>eight at a time that way.</i>

03:52.808 --> 03:54.407
<i>Plus, it softens them up,</i>

03:54.443 --> 03:56.576
<i>so you can get</i>
<i>the bones right out.</i>

03:56.612 --> 03:58.612
<i>Joe just had a baby.</i>

03:58.647 --> 04:00.447
<i>And I got a baby at home.</i>

04:00.482 --> 04:02.482
<i>I got a tub.</i>

04:03.485 --> 04:05.252
Peter, you seem off today.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.047
Are you thinking
about killing infants again?

04:07.055 --> 04:08.121
No.

04:08.157 --> 04:10.924
<i>Now you got to kill them, too.</i>

04:16.532 --> 04:17.964
Mikey, you're safe!

04:18.000 --> 04:20.534
Thank you so much
for finding my boy.

04:20.569 --> 04:22.335
Thank you for
finding<i> her</i> boy.

04:22.371 --> 04:24.504
I'm the stepfather.

04:28.010 --> 04:31.144
Peter Griffin,
in recognition of your heroism

04:31.180 --> 04:34.247
in helping to rescue
little Mikey Nicholson,

04:34.283 --> 04:38.752
I'd like to present you
with this key to the city.

04:38.787 --> 04:41.421
Now don't forget to water
the plants every other day

04:41.456 --> 04:43.023
and change the cat's litter.

04:43.058 --> 04:44.624
I'll see you in two weeks.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.359
No parties.

04:47.396 --> 04:48.728
Thank you, Mayor West.

04:48.764 --> 04:51.431
You know, some of you
out there are calling me a hero.

04:51.466 --> 04:52.899
Others are calling me a hoagie.

04:52.935 --> 04:55.402
Those of you from Connecticut
are calling me a grinder.

04:55.437 --> 04:57.037
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

04:57.072 --> 05:00.040
I'm not just pieces of meat
between pieces of bread.

05:00.075 --> 05:03.476
I am a man
who unintentionally saves kids.

05:04.479 --> 05:06.079
Wow.

05:06.114 --> 05:07.280
20 years on the force,

05:07.316 --> 05:09.015
and no one's ever clapped
for me.

05:09.051 --> 05:11.384
Except for that one
sarcastic gay guy.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.588
Great observation.

05:14.623 --> 05:17.557
I know you mean the opposite
of what you're saying.

05:17.593 --> 05:20.393
Fact is, when I saved that boy,
I wasn't thinking.

05:20.429 --> 05:22.562
I don't think. I just do.

05:22.598 --> 05:25.365
I wanted to see if a billboard
had real pudding in it,

05:25.400 --> 05:27.534
so I climbed up there
and came out a hero.

05:27.569 --> 05:29.703
It's just like Gandhi
always said,

05:29.738 --> 05:31.972
eat as much as you want
and do whatever,

05:32.007 --> 05:34.074
and don't be afraid
to hit each other.

05:37.412 --> 05:38.879
Way to go, Dad.

05:38.914 --> 05:41.648
Peter, that thing you
said about not thinking

05:41.683 --> 05:43.683
and just doing stuff,
did you mean that?

05:43.719 --> 05:44.851
Sure I did, Joe.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.119
I never stop to think.

05:46.154 --> 05:48.255
That's why I've had ringworm
11 times.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.156
I will roll in anything.

05:51.159 --> 05:53.093
You know what, you're right.

05:53.128 --> 05:55.362
And it's time I do
the same thing.

05:57.165 --> 05:58.231
Hey, Chief. It's Swanson.

05:58.267 --> 05:59.733
I quit.

05:59.768 --> 06:01.167
Joe Swanson.

06:01.203 --> 06:03.270
I don't know
if Ray Swanson's quitting.

06:03.305 --> 06:05.038
You'd have to ask him.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.207
Okay, you just called me
Ray again.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.877
I just want to confirm that
you understand that this is Joe.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.513
No, not "see you tomorrow."

06:13.548 --> 06:16.149
Joe, what are you doing?
You can't quit your job.

06:16.184 --> 06:18.218
Well, that's
the other thing, Bonnie.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.552
You and I are done, too.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.687
What?!

06:20.722 --> 06:22.455
I'm leaving you.

06:22.491 --> 06:24.491
New Joe!

06:25.928 --> 06:29.029
Wow. I can't remember the
last time Joe shot his gun.

06:29.064 --> 06:30.597
I know. That bullet's
been rolling around

06:30.632 --> 06:32.732
in his junk drawer for years.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.434
Hey, Ma, guess where I am?

06:34.469 --> 06:36.069
Yeah, can you hear it?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.037
Flying through the air.

06:37.072 --> 06:38.939
I don't know what he shot at.

06:38.974 --> 06:41.041
I guess I'll just have
to find out when I land.

06:41.076 --> 06:42.742
No, don't put Terry on.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.144
You-you can just tell him.

06:44.179 --> 06:46.479
H-Hey. Hi, Terry.

06:55.909 --> 06:57.709
Oh, God.

06:57.745 --> 06:58.777
What?
"What?"

06:58.812 --> 06:59.911
You know what.

06:59.947 --> 07:01.246
I think it looks good.

07:01.282 --> 07:03.515
You are, you are just
trying anything, aren't you?

07:03.550 --> 07:05.450
Just searching for
an identity, man.

07:05.486 --> 07:07.586
And you think this
is gonna be it, huh?

07:07.621 --> 07:09.454
Oh, God, whatever.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.156
Peter, I'm worried
about Joe.

07:11.191 --> 07:13.025
You know, not only
did he quit his job,

07:13.060 --> 07:15.193
he's moved out and gotten
his own apartment.

07:15.229 --> 07:17.796
Oh, I feel terrible for
Bonnie and the kids.

07:17.831 --> 07:20.198
Ah, they'll be fine.
They'll bounce back.

07:20.234 --> 07:22.467
Just like Humpty Dumpty did
after his fall.

07:22.503 --> 07:24.670
My God, it's a miracle!

07:24.705 --> 07:27.039
You were able to put me
back together again.

07:27.074 --> 07:29.141
Yeah, it was actually
a pretty simple procedure.

07:29.176 --> 07:31.343
Maybe next time go straight
to a medical professional

07:31.378 --> 07:33.912
and skip the horses
and illiterate servants.

07:33.947 --> 07:36.715
Well, that is the last time
I drink and masturbate

07:36.750 --> 07:38.884
on top of a high wall.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.423
Wait, wait, Quagmire, hold up.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.224
I got a great knock.

07:48.462 --> 07:50.462
Oh, I got to remember that.

07:50.497 --> 07:52.664
Oh, hey, guys.
How's it going?

07:52.700 --> 07:53.999
Hey, buddy.

07:54.034 --> 07:55.267
How you doing?

07:55.302 --> 07:56.468
You okay?

07:56.503 --> 07:58.070
Everything okay?

07:58.105 --> 08:00.839
I'm talking like this
because I'm being very careful

08:00.874 --> 08:02.808
not to upset you,
and for some reason

08:02.843 --> 08:05.143
this is the voice people use
to do that.

08:05.179 --> 08:06.611
I'm great.
Come on in.

08:06.647 --> 08:08.647
Check out the new pad.

08:08.682 --> 08:09.848
Whoa!

08:09.883 --> 08:11.316
You got an air hockey table?

08:11.352 --> 08:13.418
Yep. Wanted it, got it.

08:13.454 --> 08:14.986
That's the new Joe.

08:15.022 --> 08:16.321
And check this out.

08:16.357 --> 08:17.856
It's the gun
that no-leg sprinter used

08:17.891 --> 08:19.825
to kill his girlfriend.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.293
Oh, my God!

08:21.328 --> 08:24.062
Eh, anyone who's kind of fast
gets a free pass from me.

08:24.098 --> 08:26.164
What kind of person
would want to buy that?

08:26.200 --> 08:27.332
I'll tell you who.

08:27.368 --> 08:28.667
The kind of guy
who's always got

08:28.702 --> 08:31.603
butterscotch candies
for his friends.

08:31.638 --> 08:34.239
Okay, now that's pretty cool.

08:34.274 --> 08:36.341
I got to be honest,
Joe, we came over here

08:36.377 --> 08:37.943
because we were
worried about you,

08:37.978 --> 08:39.878
but these candies tell
me you're doing great.

08:39.913 --> 08:41.012
I've never been better.

08:41.048 --> 08:42.848
I was living my life all wrong.

08:42.883 --> 08:43.883
But not anymore.

08:43.917 --> 08:45.951
No more thinking, just living.

08:45.986 --> 08:48.019
Well, it seems like you made
the right choice, Joe.

08:48.055 --> 08:49.788
I mean, I ain't seen
anyone this happy

08:49.823 --> 08:52.457
since the invention
of the penny-farthing bicycle.

08:52.493 --> 08:54.559
Eureka! Watch it go.

08:54.595 --> 08:56.228
Higher than you,
faster than you,

08:56.263 --> 08:57.362
better than you.

08:57.398 --> 08:59.698
Everyone just stop inventing
stuff now,

08:59.733 --> 09:01.600
'cause no one
will ever top this.

09:01.635 --> 09:03.435
Oh, no!

09:03.470 --> 09:04.903
Keep rakes away.

09:04.938 --> 09:07.339
I expressly said no rakes
allowed on the street

09:07.374 --> 09:10.375
when I am riding my
futuristic machine.

09:12.746 --> 09:14.513
Children, this is progress!

09:14.548 --> 09:17.949
How can you turn a blind eye
to progress?!

09:19.787 --> 09:23.588
I expressly said "no rakes."

09:27.628 --> 09:28.927
'Sup, ladies?

09:28.962 --> 09:30.662
Oh, we're not ladies, you.

09:30.697 --> 09:31.857
Hey, what's with
the suitcase?

09:31.865 --> 09:33.365
I got a surprise.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.567
What would you guys think
of a road trip?

09:35.602 --> 09:36.802
Yeah!
All right, I'm in!

09:36.837 --> 09:37.837
Awesome, road trip!

09:37.871 --> 09:40.205
I love being super pumped
for 15 minutes

09:40.240 --> 09:42.040
and then bored out of my mind
for eight hours.

09:42.042 --> 09:43.074
Where we going?

09:43.110 --> 09:44.976
Well, I was thinking
Niagara Falls.

09:45.012 --> 09:46.178
Niagara Falls?

09:46.213 --> 09:47.312
Ain't that just for lovers?

09:47.347 --> 09:48.447
Nah, it's for everybody.

09:48.482 --> 09:49.748
It's great to just stand there

09:49.783 --> 09:51.917
and let Mother Nature spray it
all over your face.

09:51.952 --> 09:55.654
Donna's big fat aunt is in town,
so I can definitely go.

09:59.693 --> 10:02.260
Man, I am filling
these Gatorade bottles

10:02.296 --> 10:03.628
as fast as I'm drinking them.

10:03.664 --> 10:04.896
Ah, sweet! Cows!

10:04.932 --> 10:06.031
Let's tip them over.

10:06.066 --> 10:07.933
What? You want
to tip over some cows?

10:07.968 --> 10:09.601
Hell yeah!

10:12.639 --> 10:14.306
This is gonna
be so boss.

10:14.341 --> 10:16.041
I can't wait.

10:16.076 --> 10:19.611
This is the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

10:19.646 --> 10:20.812
All right, cow.

10:20.848 --> 10:24.182
This is what you get
for standing.

10:24.218 --> 10:25.784
That...

10:25.819 --> 10:27.219
was awesome.

10:27.254 --> 10:28.720
<i>I want to kiss that cow,</i>

10:28.755 --> 10:30.555
<i>but I don't want it</i>
<i>to be my idea.</i>

10:30.591 --> 10:33.024
Hey, Peter, you should
kiss that cow.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.893
<i>All right, Peter,</i>
<i>that was fortuitous.</i>

10:34.928 --> 10:36.127
<i>But play it cool.</i>

10:36.163 --> 10:37.395
Oh, Cleveland, I couldn't.

10:37.431 --> 10:40.298
Okay. Quagmire,
you should kiss that cow.

10:40.334 --> 10:41.633
Sure, why not?

10:48.008 --> 10:49.908
Okay, they're sleeping.

10:49.943 --> 10:52.043
We're gonna have to party
in the bathroom.

10:52.079 --> 10:53.945
Be careful around
the really fat one.

10:53.981 --> 10:55.714
He's kind of like my boss.

10:55.749 --> 10:57.616
What? Who-who's there?

10:58.652 --> 11:00.252
Joe, what the hell
are you doing?

11:00.287 --> 11:01.920
I went to
a high school kegger party.

11:01.955 --> 11:03.121
Made a few new friends.

11:03.156 --> 11:05.457
This is Chrysalis,
Ichabod and Cancer.

11:05.492 --> 11:07.626
Oh, I see
three young men

11:07.661 --> 11:09.494
who could use the
tickle monster.

11:09.530 --> 11:11.329
Uh, that's a bad read, Pete.

11:11.365 --> 11:12.697
Joe, it's 3:00
in the morning.

11:12.733 --> 11:13.865
We're trying to
get some sleep.

11:13.901 --> 11:15.267
You guys are lame.

11:15.302 --> 11:17.168
We're gonna go smoke
something called "croak."

11:18.305 --> 11:20.138
God, what the hell
has gotten into Joe?

11:20.173 --> 11:21.406
I don't know, Quagmire.

11:21.441 --> 11:23.108
Maybe you could
ask the tickle monster!

11:23.143 --> 11:24.463
Stop it! Here he comes!

11:24.478 --> 11:25.944
No! Get away!
He's gonna get ya!

11:25.979 --> 11:27.045
Look out!

11:27.080 --> 11:29.180
Great, now I'm fully up.

11:39.893 --> 11:42.594
Here we are, guys,
Niagara Falls.

11:42.629 --> 11:44.229
We showed them.

11:44.264 --> 11:45.964
We showed them all!

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
Showed who? What the
hell's he talking about?

11:48.035 --> 11:49.301
I don't know.

11:49.336 --> 11:51.369
I stopped listening to him
back at the drive-thru

11:51.405 --> 11:54.239
when he leaned out the window
and ordered a "fur burger."

11:54.274 --> 11:56.708
That's not funny;
that's just nasty.

11:56.743 --> 11:59.911
Plus, there's people waiting
behind you!

12:03.450 --> 12:05.617
Wow. You know, when
you see it up close,

12:05.652 --> 12:07.218
it really is
incredible.

12:07.254 --> 12:09.821
Yeah. Holy crap,
it's beautiful.

12:09.856 --> 12:13.325
In the future, I believe
there will be water wars.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.560
You know, Lois always dreamed
about coming here,

12:15.596 --> 12:17.162
and now I know why.

12:17.197 --> 12:19.965
She was even
saving money for it.

12:24.504 --> 12:25.971
You made it, Lois.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.472
You made it.

12:27.507 --> 12:28.707
Didn't I tell you guys?

12:28.742 --> 12:30.809
It's the most magnificent place
in the world.

12:30.844 --> 12:33.511
And the greatest place
to end it all.

12:33.547 --> 12:34.913
Good-bye, fellas.

12:41.212 --> 12:43.779
Oh, my God, Joe killed himself!

12:43.814 --> 12:45.214
It's so weird
that he argued

12:45.249 --> 12:47.249
over the price
of breakfast this morning.

12:47.284 --> 12:49.017
It makes no sense!

12:49.053 --> 12:50.185
Damn it!

12:50.221 --> 12:51.286
Joe?

12:51.322 --> 12:53.722
Joe, you're alive!

12:53.757 --> 12:55.157
Are you hurt?

12:55.192 --> 12:56.792
I'm not sure.

12:56.827 --> 12:58.560
Well, hang in there, Joe,
we'll get some help.

12:58.596 --> 13:00.729
No! Just let me die!

13:00.764 --> 13:02.030
Oh, no, can't do that, Joe.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.066
We're friends.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.366
We look out for each other.

13:04.401 --> 13:05.681
I mean, you supported me
that day

13:05.703 --> 13:08.070
I accidentally wore
Lois's jeans.

13:09.073 --> 13:10.606
Peter, you know
you're wearing...

13:10.641 --> 13:12.708
I know. I think
there was a mix-up.

13:12.743 --> 13:16.311
Oh, thank you, Jazzercize.

13:18.349 --> 13:19.949
Don't worry, Joe.
They're coming for you.

13:19.984 --> 13:22.517
Yay! My backpack.

13:24.588 --> 13:25.821
Hang in there, Joe.

13:25.856 --> 13:27.689
After they get that lady's hat,
you're next.

13:27.725 --> 13:28.991
Thank you.

13:29.026 --> 13:30.659
It's windy up here.

13:37.501 --> 13:39.101
Joe, what the hell
is wrong with you?

13:39.136 --> 13:40.669
Why would you try
to kill yourself?

13:40.704 --> 13:42.838
Why do you think? I'm worthless.

13:42.873 --> 13:45.307
But y-you've been so happy
these last few days.

13:45.342 --> 13:46.408
I've been manic.

13:46.443 --> 13:48.076
Do you think Andy Dick
is happy?

13:48.112 --> 13:49.511
I couldn't imagine, no.

13:49.546 --> 13:51.613
Look, when I saw Peter
become a hero,

13:51.649 --> 13:54.349
I guess it reminded me
of all the things I can't do.

13:54.385 --> 13:56.318
I'm a cop who can't save anyone.

13:56.353 --> 13:58.687
I'm a husband
in a legless marriage.

13:58.722 --> 14:00.289
My whole life is a joke.

14:00.324 --> 14:03.091
But somehow, as soon
as I decided to kill myself,

14:03.127 --> 14:04.626
I actually felt free.

14:04.662 --> 14:05.994
Almost giddy.

14:06.030 --> 14:09.164
I can finally kiss
this worthless life good-bye.

14:09.199 --> 14:10.532
Let me get
this straight.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.501
The whole point of bringing
us to Niagara Falls

14:12.536 --> 14:13.902
was just to
kill yourself?

14:13.937 --> 14:15.971
I'm sorry I tricked
you guys into coming.

14:16.006 --> 14:18.907
I just wanted to spend
my last week with my best pals.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.109
Well, not for nothing, but
you could've taken us all

14:21.145 --> 14:23.178
to Disney World and shot
yourself in the room.

14:23.213 --> 14:25.213
Come on, Joe, there's plenty
of reasons to live.

14:25.249 --> 14:26.948
Like, like, you're handsome.

14:26.984 --> 14:28.850
You have a handsome face.

14:28.886 --> 14:30.319
Well, he's got
a good chin.

14:30.354 --> 14:31.687
I don't know
about handsome.

14:31.722 --> 14:33.155
Yeah, he's not handsome,
but I will say this,

14:33.190 --> 14:34.589
he keeps a good lawn.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.892
Yeah, some might say the second
best lawn in the neighborhood.

14:36.927 --> 14:38.927
Hey, wait, where's Joe?

14:39.930 --> 14:41.363
Joe, wait!

14:47.271 --> 14:49.071
I stink at this.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.609
Anywhere is fine.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.778
Guys, this is
unnecessary.

14:56.814 --> 14:58.313
Give me my chair back.

14:58.349 --> 15:00.449
No, we can't trust you
not to kill yourself.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.884
Yeah, then you'd be
the tenth friend

15:01.919 --> 15:03.785
who's killed himself
in front of me.

15:03.821 --> 15:04.821
Is that true?

15:04.855 --> 15:06.421
One, two, three,
four, five,

15:06.457 --> 15:07.723
six, seven...

15:07.758 --> 15:09.791
those two girls and...

15:09.827 --> 15:11.226
Yeah, yeah, ten.

15:11.261 --> 15:12.861
Look, you guys,
what we really need to do

15:12.896 --> 15:14.963
is bring him back to Quahog
where we can get him some help.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.164
That's a good idea.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.466
We should just go home.

15:17.501 --> 15:18.734
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

15:18.769 --> 15:20.569
It's too bad we already
bought those tickets

15:20.604 --> 15:22.070
for the Whirlpool
Aero Car.

15:22.106 --> 15:24.473
That's $16
we're not getting back.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.475
Yeah, what a waste of money.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.443
It is only a ten-minute
ride, you know.

15:28.479 --> 15:30.178
Okay, we'll do
the Whirlpool Aero Car,

15:30.214 --> 15:31.847
and then take Joe
back to Quahog.

15:31.882 --> 15:34.049
What about
the White Water Walk?

15:34.084 --> 15:35.550
Okay, okay, Whirlpool Aero Car,

15:35.586 --> 15:38.954
then White Water Walk,
then we bring Joe back.

15:38.989 --> 15:40.389
Well, you can't do
Niagara Falls

15:40.424 --> 15:41.824
without riding the
<i>Maid of the Mist.</i>

15:41.825 --> 15:43.325
Yeah, let's do everything.
Great!

15:43.360 --> 15:46.228
And, guys, remember,
the pool towels go home with us.

15:46.263 --> 15:48.330
They got no way
of accounting for those.

16:00.177 --> 16:03.478
Well, this has just been
one heck of a fun day.

16:03.514 --> 16:04.713
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

16:04.748 --> 16:06.515
seeing the natural beauty
of this place

16:06.550 --> 16:08.417
is actually making me
feel much better.

16:08.452 --> 16:11.153
Hey, you mind opening that door?

16:11.188 --> 16:13.588
Get a little breeze in here?

16:13.624 --> 16:15.357
Sure.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.794
Peter, no!

16:22.299 --> 16:24.599
I don't regret it.
The breeze is nice.

16:35.379 --> 16:37.345
Oh, crap, I'm losing my grip!

16:37.381 --> 16:40.048
You buy your jeans
at Wal-Mart?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.051
No, somebody who lost theirs
at the church did.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.020
You wear
lost-and-found jeans?

16:45.055 --> 16:47.355
I waited the mandatory week.

16:47.391 --> 16:48.957
Hang on, guys!

17:03.040 --> 17:05.040
Don't worry, I'm coming!

17:18.722 --> 17:20.155
What's that thing he's on?

17:20.190 --> 17:22.090
It's a chair with wheels!

17:22.125 --> 17:24.593
He's an absolute dream.

17:43.981 --> 17:45.780
Guys, keep swallowing water.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.816
We'll drink our way
out of this.

18:06.803 --> 18:09.938
Guys, grab on to my legs!

18:12.476 --> 18:13.742
Got it!

18:13.777 --> 18:15.810
Ew. You know, this is actually
the first time

18:15.846 --> 18:17.379
I've ever touched Joe.

18:17.414 --> 18:19.314
Don't worry, I gotcha.

18:27.591 --> 18:29.057
Oh, thank God, Joe.

18:29.092 --> 18:30.392
I thought I was dead!

18:30.427 --> 18:32.427
I even pictured
my own funeral.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.774
Yeah, definitely.

19:52.809 --> 19:54.442
All right, okay,
don't anyone sing anything else

19:54.478 --> 19:56.311
until we get home.
We got to record this.

19:56.346 --> 19:58.213
Yeah, that'll be great.

19:58.248 --> 20:01.416
♪ I'm a Barbie girl
in a Barbie world ♪

20:01.451 --> 20:03.084
♪ Come on, Barbie,
let's go party! ♪

20:03.120 --> 20:04.152
Peter, damn it, no!

20:04.187 --> 20:05.620
Wait, wait, we got to remember
the other one.

20:05.656 --> 20:07.022
What was it, Joe?

20:07.057 --> 20:09.791
It's gone.

20:13.830 --> 20:16.598
Well, that was kind of a weird
trip, but I'm glad we went.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.199
Yeah, I love
Niagara Falls.

20:18.235 --> 20:20.802
I was the only black man
ever to go there.

20:20.837 --> 20:22.804
The tourists were
taking pictures of me.

20:22.839 --> 20:24.739
One of them thought
I was a bear.

20:24.775 --> 20:25.940
Hey, guys.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.676
Wow, Joe, you got your job back?

20:27.711 --> 20:28.743
Sure did.

20:28.779 --> 20:29.844
How'd you pull that off?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.713
Ah, they always need more cops.

20:31.748 --> 20:33.314
Turns out not many people

20:33.350 --> 20:36.518
want to probably get shot
for $24,000 a year.

20:36.553 --> 20:37.585
And what about Bonnie?

20:37.621 --> 20:39.187
How you getting her back?

20:39.222 --> 20:40.455
Well, I got a plan for that.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.357
I hired some guys
to come to the house

20:42.392 --> 20:45.181
on Tuesday and assault her,
and I'll come in and save her,

20:45.182 --> 20:48.011
and she'll be so grateful,
she'll have to take me back.

20:48.191 --> 20:49.390
Joe, today's Tuesday.

20:49.391 --> 20:50.991

@elder_man

20:50.992 --> 20:52.797
Well, poop.
