00:34.437 --> 00:38.140
We now return to
yet another Indiana Jones movie.

00:39.241 --> 00:41.542
Snakes. Why did it
have to be snakes?

00:41.576 --> 00:43.077
Elderly potheads.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.947
Why did it have to be
elderly potheads?

00:45.981 --> 00:48.515
Is everyone warm in here?
Is it warm?

00:48.550 --> 00:49.951
Brian, are you
feeling all right?

00:49.985 --> 00:51.718
Yeah, I'm fine. It
just seems kind of...

00:52.854 --> 00:53.955
Oh, my God!

00:53.989 --> 00:55.556
Oh, Lois,
your dog threw up.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.324
Peter, Brian's clearly
not feeling well.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.259
You got to take him
to the vet.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.961
Unbelievable!
Brian throws up once,

01:00.995 --> 01:02.762
and you rush him
to the vet.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.764
I was throwing up
all night last night.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.532
Good start.
Keep it up, snack pack.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.803
Peter, you got
to take him now!

01:10.838 --> 01:12.638
L-Lois, it's probably
just something I ate.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.939
I-I'm fine.
Really.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.976
I-I got more energy than
a cruise ship conga line.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.810
♪ Horny on a big boat

01:18.845 --> 01:20.612
♪ Horny
on a big boat! ♪

01:20.646 --> 01:23.282
I'm very sick
from lobster.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.788
Brian, your blood work
shows that your liver

01:29.822 --> 01:30.955
isn't functioning
properly.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.756
Would you happen
to be a drinker?

01:32.791 --> 01:35.159
Well, I don't know
if I'd label myself a drinker.

01:35.194 --> 01:38.329
I know I like a cold beer
after I mow the lawn.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.531
There were three lies
in that sentence.

01:40.565 --> 01:42.833
Brian, have you ever heard
of Lou Gehrig's disease?

01:42.868 --> 01:43.901
Oh, no!

01:43.935 --> 01:46.304
Well, you have
Mickey Mantle's disease.

01:46.338 --> 01:50.173
Now, the most obvious step would
simply be to stop drinking.

01:50.208 --> 01:51.441
Or...?

01:51.476 --> 01:53.643
Well, we do have these pills
that may correct

01:53.677 --> 01:55.879
the enzyme imbalance in your liver.
Yeah, that one.

01:55.913 --> 01:57.347
Okay, I'll be
in the waiting room

01:57.382 --> 01:59.182
barking at the fish
in the tank.

01:59.217 --> 02:00.350
All right,
Mr. Griffin,

02:00.385 --> 02:02.219
these pills will clear up
Brian's condition.

02:02.253 --> 02:05.421
But unfortunately, they only
come in suppository form.

02:05.455 --> 02:06.455
Uh...

02:06.456 --> 02:08.257
It means they have
to be inserted

02:08.291 --> 02:09.625
into the patient's anus.

02:09.659 --> 02:12.395
Oh, you're a
dirty doctor, aren't you?

02:12.429 --> 02:14.897
Mr. Griffin, I'm not joking--
or a doctor.

02:14.931 --> 02:16.932
Now, you'll need
to administer these pills,

02:16.966 --> 02:19.735
because no dog ever voluntarily
takes a suppository.

02:19.769 --> 02:21.369
Well, one in ten does.

02:21.404 --> 02:23.671
Oh, I know the one--
Brian's cousin Jasper.

02:23.705 --> 02:25.306
His bum looks
like that guy

02:25.341 --> 02:27.509
with a hundred cigarettes
in his mouth.

02:35.817 --> 02:37.985
Hey, Chris, I noticed
you were sitting alone.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.520
You mind if I join you?

02:39.554 --> 02:41.155
Sure. We both
have hats.

02:41.189 --> 02:43.157
Makes sense.
Oh, thanks.

02:43.191 --> 02:45.792
Hey, can you check my back
for "kick me" signs?

02:45.826 --> 02:47.994
Oh, yeah, you got
a couple.

02:48.029 --> 02:50.130
This one says you're
a "dirty kick."

02:50.165 --> 02:52.132
That doesn't say "kick,"
but thanks,

02:52.167 --> 02:54.368
I'll keep that one
for my lawsuit.

02:54.402 --> 02:56.502
Boys, I got a
new home gym.

02:56.537 --> 02:58.504
Why are you telling us that?

02:58.539 --> 03:00.173
Just letting
people know.

03:00.207 --> 03:03.709
Don't want anyone to get freaked
out by the transformation.

03:03.743 --> 03:05.744
I got to say, it
feels kind of weird

03:05.779 --> 03:07.447
having someone
join me for lunch.

03:07.481 --> 03:08.881
Well, it's
only natural, Chris.

03:08.915 --> 03:10.883
You and I are
social exiles.

03:10.917 --> 03:13.685
We're the Khaleesi and
Jorah Mormont of this school.

03:13.719 --> 03:16.188
Sure, I'll agree to keep
the conversation going.

03:16.222 --> 03:19.458
Well, time to break out
my terrible Jewish bag lunch.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.059
Let's see.
Smoked whitefish,

03:21.094 --> 03:23.061
herring in cream sauce,
smoked sable--

03:23.096 --> 03:24.729
that's a different kind
of whitefish--

03:24.763 --> 03:27.665
and for dessert, the only
bad cookie in the world.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.833
Hey, what's it like
<i>buying</i> food from school?

03:29.867 --> 03:31.935
It's good. I know
everyone back there,

03:31.970 --> 03:33.971
so they let me drink
their corn water.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.740
Boy, it's so great having
someone I can talk to.

03:36.774 --> 03:38.242
I feel the same way, Chris.

03:38.276 --> 03:40.744
I think you and I could
get along very nicely.

03:40.778 --> 03:44.415
Yeah. We'll be a better team
than the Warsaw Globetrotters.

All right, Brian,
it's time for you to take

04:06.536 --> 04:08.137
one of these pills
from the vet.

04:08.171 --> 04:10.305
Oh, yeah, right. Can we
do what we normally do,

04:10.340 --> 04:12.141
where you roll it up
in a piece of cheese

04:12.175 --> 04:13.742
like you're fooling me?
Yeah, I guess,

04:13.776 --> 04:15.810
but then you're gonna
have cheese in your ass.

04:15.845 --> 04:17.379
W-Wait, what?
Yeah, the doctor said

04:17.413 --> 04:19.615
I got to give you
these pills the butt way.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.449
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That is not happening.

04:21.483 --> 04:23.451
No, no, no. I do not
go the butt way.

04:23.485 --> 04:25.052
Look, I know it sounds
a little rough,

04:25.086 --> 04:27.555
but why don't we start with
a gentle massage of the area

04:27.589 --> 04:28.722
and see how you feel?

04:28.757 --> 04:30.158
Peter, get away from my ass!

04:30.192 --> 04:32.693
Br-Brian! No!

04:32.727 --> 04:35.563
Huh. Guess I'm just gonna
have to take him by surprise.

04:35.597 --> 04:36.997
Shouldn't be too hard.

04:37.032 --> 04:39.399
After all, I used to be
a Pete-in-the-box.

04:51.745 --> 04:53.880
Goes the weasel!

04:57.050 --> 04:58.984
All right, if I'm gonna
give Brian his medicine,

04:59.018 --> 05:00.986
I should probably watch
that old episode of <i>Lassie</i>

05:01.020 --> 05:03.589
where Timmy has to give
her a suppository.

05:07.294 --> 05:09.495
What's that, Lassie?
You feel sick?

05:09.529 --> 05:12.129
What's wrong, girl?

05:13.465 --> 05:14.765
A supposi-what?

05:14.800 --> 05:17.034
What am I supposed
to do with it?

05:18.304 --> 05:19.770
Gosh. I...

05:19.805 --> 05:23.174
Well, if you're
in that much pain, I-I guess.

05:23.209 --> 05:24.775
Okay.

05:30.281 --> 05:31.415
You were lying?

05:31.449 --> 05:32.849
You <i>weren't</i>
feeling sick?

05:32.883 --> 05:34.284
I don't understand.

05:34.319 --> 05:36.386
Why did you want me
to do this?

05:38.055 --> 05:40.023
What?!
He was in on it?

05:40.057 --> 05:41.692
It was just a prank?

05:41.726 --> 05:43.760
You guys are gross!

05:47.731 --> 05:49.865
Kids, everybody, family meeting!

05:49.899 --> 05:51.934
There's too much passing
gas in this house.

05:51.968 --> 05:54.370
So from now on, anytime
you got to cut one,

05:54.404 --> 05:56.572
you pull your pants
down and you do it

05:56.607 --> 05:57.740
through this
fart hole.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.041
Are you insane?

05:59.075 --> 06:00.643
Lois, it's
okay-- it's all a trick.

06:00.677 --> 06:03.245
As soon as Brian does it, I'm
gonna be on the other side,

06:03.279 --> 06:04.812
and I'll stick
the suppository in.

06:04.847 --> 06:06.414
No. Absolutely not.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.416
I am not living like this.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.819
You think Morgan Fairchild
has a fart hole in her house?

06:11.854 --> 06:14.222
Morgan, the coq
Au vin is divine.

06:14.257 --> 06:15.890
But so rich.

06:15.924 --> 06:17.925
Will you excuse me?

06:22.029 --> 06:24.131
Where do our
Hollywood farts go?

06:24.165 --> 06:27.768
I've heard they're filtered
into Tom Sizemore's house.

06:30.972 --> 06:33.774
Ah... Morgan.

06:37.878 --> 06:39.512
Hey, no, no.
No, no, Brian.

06:39.546 --> 06:41.547
No, no. You win.
You win. I quit.

06:41.582 --> 06:43.549
It's your liver; you
do whatever you want.

06:43.584 --> 06:45.485
Well, thank you.
Yes, it is my liver,

06:45.519 --> 06:47.420
and I don't want
to take that pill.

06:47.454 --> 06:49.021
Fine. We're both
in agreement.

06:49.055 --> 06:50.790
So let's just
both watch TV.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.925
And nothing else.
Sounds good to me.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.160
I'm glad you think
it sounds good.

06:57.263 --> 06:58.563
It's nice to watch TV

06:58.598 --> 07:00.599
when you have nothing
else to do, isn't it?

07:00.633 --> 07:01.800
Yeah.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.568
Get over here, you idiot!
Peter! What the hell?

07:03.603 --> 07:05.407
I'm still in charge of you!
Stop it! Get away from me!

07:05.408 --> 07:06.070
I'm a human!

07:06.071 --> 07:07.972
This is for your benefit,
so just go limp and take it!

07:08.007 --> 07:09.775
You touch my ass,
I swear to God I'll kill you!

07:14.513 --> 07:16.280
Wha... What the hell?

07:16.315 --> 07:18.449
You... you bit me!

07:18.483 --> 07:20.184
You're damn right I did!
And I'll do it again

07:20.218 --> 07:21.952
if you don't stay
the hell away from my ass!

07:21.986 --> 07:23.854
But, Brian, the vet said...

07:25.190 --> 07:27.390
Wow, where did that come from?

07:27.425 --> 07:28.825
God, that was so intense.

07:28.859 --> 07:31.728
I feel more powerful
than a lesbian's crotch.

07:32.996 --> 07:35.498
Ooh, sorry, ma'am,
we don't valet motorcycles.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.367
Heh. Don't need to.

07:47.344 --> 07:48.977
Lois, can you pour
my juice?

07:49.011 --> 07:50.379
I can't lift my arm.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.348
I still can't believe
Brian bit you.

07:52.382 --> 07:54.182
It just doesn't
seem like him.

07:54.217 --> 07:56.184
Oh, yeah, 'cause you
know him so well.

07:56.219 --> 07:57.720
Shut your face.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.657
Oh. Uh... hey, Brian.

08:03.892 --> 08:06.361
Get out of that chair.
Leave the eggs.

08:06.395 --> 08:08.396
But this is my breakfast.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.672
Honey, when did Peter Griffin
take up jogging?

08:17.706 --> 08:19.673
I don't know, dear.
By the way,

08:19.707 --> 08:22.376
we're the couple who lives
a few blocks away.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.078
We now return
to an '80s teen movie

08:31.112 --> 08:32.846
at a realistic high school.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.915
You're going down at
that karate tournament.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.416
I don't think so.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.850
You guys do karate?

08:37.884 --> 08:39.952
You're both
losers.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.455
Uh, morning, sir.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.623
So, Peter, I assume if
you're watching TV,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.859
that means you already
did all my chores?

08:46.893 --> 08:48.294
I-I sure did, sure did.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.496
I scared off the mailman,
threatened Quagmire's cat,

08:50.531 --> 08:52.532
and I even took
your bath for you.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.732
Now I'm just gonna reach
for the shampoo.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.535
No jumping out.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.140
He's got Rupert!

09:02.175 --> 09:03.608
Hey, drop it.
Drop it.

09:03.642 --> 09:05.177
Drop it.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.179
All right, I need you to
buy a birthday present

09:07.213 --> 09:09.981
for my friend Jeff-- he likes
the Packers and surfing.

09:10.015 --> 09:11.415
Enough is enough, Peter.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.750
The dog's not in charge
of this house.

09:13.785 --> 09:16.687
First thing tomorrow, I'm
taking Brian to obedience school

09:16.721 --> 09:18.922
so we can get him
back under control.

09:18.957 --> 09:21.492
You know, sending him to school
wouldn't be the worst idea.

09:21.526 --> 09:24.861
He might even enjoy it.
I know I had a blast in college.

09:24.896 --> 09:27.730
Man, I love college.
So many chicks, so many parties.

09:27.764 --> 09:29.299
Yeah, totally.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.334
I'm supposed to meet
the R.A. for coffee

09:31.368 --> 09:33.069
later in the common room,
but until then,

09:33.104 --> 09:35.004
I'm just gonna walk around
with my shower caddy

09:35.038 --> 09:37.873
and see what people wrote
on their whiteboards.

09:41.812 --> 09:45.147
Uh, before I touch anything,
is this a nut-free counter?

09:45.181 --> 09:48.550
I don't know-- my dad's might
have been on there this morning.

09:48.585 --> 09:49.918
Oh, hey, Meg.

09:49.952 --> 09:53.155
I saw you stomp that pigeon
today with your bare foot.

09:53.189 --> 09:54.856
Pretty powerful stuff.

09:54.890 --> 09:57.626
Thanks. I don't like losing
any part of my lunch.

09:57.660 --> 10:00.162
Look, I'd love to stay and talk,
Neil, but I have homework,

10:00.196 --> 10:02.296
and there was no toilet paper
in the girls' bathroom.

10:02.331 --> 10:04.698
Well, while you freshen up,
maybe I could help you get

10:04.733 --> 10:06.100
a head start
on that homework.

10:06.135 --> 10:07.268
You'd do that?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.003
Wow, that'd be great!

10:09.037 --> 10:12.306
Wait, Neil, I thought you and I
were gonna go find unlocked cars

10:12.341 --> 10:14.041
and pretend
we're driving them.

10:14.075 --> 10:17.111
Sorry, Chris.
Booty calls.

10:17.146 --> 10:18.512
What was that all about?

10:18.546 --> 10:21.047
Well, I guess
I have to do it by myself.

10:23.017 --> 10:25.852
Boy, this light
is taking forever!

10:26.854 --> 10:29.189
Please get out.
I never drive this car.

10:29.223 --> 10:31.158
My wife died in it.

10:37.096 --> 10:39.565
Listen up, maggots,
you're in my house now!

10:39.599 --> 10:41.367
There are no belly
scratches here!

10:41.401 --> 10:43.068
There are no table scraps!

10:43.102 --> 10:44.736
What we have here are good dogs!

10:44.771 --> 10:47.206
No bandana-wearing,
Frisbee-catching hippie dogs!

10:47.240 --> 10:50.342
No parking lot, hind-leg dancing
YouTube dogs!

10:50.377 --> 10:53.645
No crime solving, camera
mugging Scooby Dooby dogs!

10:53.679 --> 10:55.046
Oh, no Scooby Doo, huh?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.514
Ruh-roh.

10:56.549 --> 10:58.683
Oh, it seems we got
us a comedy dog.

10:58.717 --> 11:01.152
Are you Kathy Griffin?
'Cause I ain't laughing.

11:01.187 --> 11:02.654
So maybe you are
Kathy Griffin.

11:02.688 --> 11:04.222
Or maybe you're
that comedy dog

11:04.256 --> 11:06.324
with Robert Smigel's
hand up your backside.

11:06.358 --> 11:08.359
Well, let me tell you
something, comedy dog.

11:08.394 --> 11:10.093
You're here for
<i>me</i> to poop on!

11:10.127 --> 11:11.961
All right, first of all,
it seems like

11:11.996 --> 11:14.531
you have a lot of opinions
about a lot of comedians.

11:14.566 --> 11:15.765
And second of all... Ow!

11:15.800 --> 11:17.634
That hurts!
- That's right.

11:17.669 --> 11:19.736
Silent and terrible,
like <i>The Artist.</i>

11:19.770 --> 11:21.705
I watch a lot of
TV and movies.

11:21.739 --> 11:24.040
I am your media-savvy
worst nightmare!

11:24.075 --> 11:26.742
Now, down on all fours
like the rest of them!

11:26.776 --> 11:29.445
That's right, we got ways
to break your spirit!

11:29.479 --> 11:34.016
In fact, you seem like a
prime candidate for The Chair.

11:46.095 --> 11:48.830
Honey, did you hear
a dog scream?

11:48.864 --> 11:50.832
Yes, I did, dear.

11:50.866 --> 11:53.868
Our summer cabin is near
the obedience school.

11:58.006 --> 12:00.074
Move along.
Got to keep the hallway clear.

12:00.109 --> 12:02.042
This isn't because
of my divorce.

12:02.076 --> 12:03.477
Good for him.

12:03.511 --> 12:06.179
He actually followed through.

12:07.882 --> 12:09.983
What the hell? Again?

12:10.017 --> 12:11.685
Thanks for doing
my book report, Neil.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.854
And I didn't even have
to change the handwriting,

12:13.888 --> 12:15.389
'cause you write
like a girl.

12:15.423 --> 12:17.323
You should see me throw.

12:17.358 --> 12:19.992
Listen, Meg, would you want
to go to a movie sometime?

12:20.026 --> 12:22.027
You know what?

12:22.062 --> 12:24.029
I'd like that.
It's a date.

12:24.064 --> 12:26.165
Okay, well, I'll, uh...
I'll see you later.

12:26.199 --> 12:28.067
Home Ec just got out.

12:28.101 --> 12:30.102
I'm gonna go lick
all their bowls.

12:31.338 --> 12:33.906
Hey, Neil.
Oh, h-hey, Chris.

12:33.940 --> 12:37.041
You sure are spending a lot
of time with my sister lately.

12:37.076 --> 12:38.910
You know, if I didn't
know better,

12:38.944 --> 12:40.945
I'd think
that fish are ghosts.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.882
And I'd also think
you're putting the moves on Meg.

12:45.451 --> 12:48.553
Listen, Chris, you're my
friend, so I have to confess.

12:48.588 --> 12:50.789
My sitting with you
at lunch was part

12:50.823 --> 12:53.691
of a carefully laid-out plan
to get close to your sister.

12:53.725 --> 12:55.626
What?!
Look, I know it sounds terrible.

12:55.661 --> 12:58.729
But-but still, we've had
some good times together.

12:58.764 --> 13:01.632
We even got Sean Penn
to dress up as my dad.

13:04.169 --> 13:06.937
Go away! I never want
to talk to you again!

13:08.339 --> 13:09.906
God, I should have known it.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.374
I feel more betrayed

13:11.409 --> 13:14.210
than when I thought
that lawyer was gonna propose.

13:14.244 --> 13:15.978
So you did
commit the murder?

13:16.013 --> 13:17.547
Uh-huh.

13:17.581 --> 13:19.916
And you admit it here
in front of everyone?

13:19.950 --> 13:21.484
Uh-huh.

13:21.519 --> 13:23.820
No further questions,
Your Honor.

13:23.854 --> 13:26.154
Wait. No further questions?

13:26.189 --> 13:30.158
Motion to have the last eight
years stricken from the record!

13:38.267 --> 13:39.835
Hey, Brian,
you're back!

13:39.869 --> 13:42.003
Come on in.
In... inside?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.938
Are-are...
are you sure?

13:43.972 --> 13:45.573
Yeah, what-what...
yeah, what do you think,

13:45.607 --> 13:47.475
I'm gonna make you
stay in the yard?

13:47.509 --> 13:49.510
Get in here.

13:51.079 --> 13:55.015
Sir, if it takes the rest of
my life, I will repay you.

13:55.050 --> 13:56.351
Who's this puss?

13:56.385 --> 13:58.219
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm-I'm not a cat.

13:58.253 --> 14:00.286
I'm-I'm a dog.
I'm your pet.

14:00.321 --> 14:02.456
And-and I'm just happy
to be here.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.524
Brian, what did they do
to you at that school?

14:04.559 --> 14:06.626
You're-you're
so... submissive.

14:06.661 --> 14:08.962
Yes, looks like someone's
gone at him with a "hwhip."

14:08.996 --> 14:11.798
That is... that is a perfectly
valid way of saying that.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.800
Bravo, Master.
Master?

14:13.835 --> 14:17.570
And a surprisingly quick
erection for Stewie.

14:24.135 --> 14:26.103
There you go.

14:26.137 --> 14:27.314
You-you look
very dapper, sir.

14:27.315 --> 14:28.548
Thanks, Brian.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.150
God, I love the new you.

14:30.184 --> 14:32.385
That obedience school really
schooled you in obedience.

14:33.687 --> 14:35.354
That's why it's
called that!

14:35.388 --> 14:38.224
Permission to take fast,
tiny bites of my own tail, sir?

14:38.258 --> 14:40.259
Granted.

14:40.293 --> 14:41.961
You're wearing a bow tie?

14:41.996 --> 14:43.395
What's the occasion?

14:43.430 --> 14:44.631
No occasion, Lois.

14:44.665 --> 14:46.633
I just want to piss
a couple of guys off.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.134
What the hell are you doing?

14:48.168 --> 14:49.869
You think you're
better than us?

14:49.903 --> 14:52.203
No way you tied
that on your own.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.243
I'm glad we got here early.

14:58.277 --> 14:59.678
I like to watch
the previews.

14:59.712 --> 15:03.115
Yeah, and also the friendly
warning about theater shootings.

15:04.483 --> 15:07.218
♪ Don't get shot by a bullet

15:07.253 --> 15:09.720
♪ Don't get shot
by a bullet ♪

15:09.755 --> 15:12.723
♪ Keep your wits about you

15:12.758 --> 15:15.693
♪ This place used to be fun!

15:15.727 --> 15:17.461
You know, this is nice.

15:17.495 --> 15:19.596
It's actually the first time
I've been on a date

15:19.631 --> 15:21.165
since I got the nickname
Gutterball.

15:21.199 --> 15:22.533
It is nice.

15:22.567 --> 15:24.135
Here, hold still.

15:25.169 --> 15:27.170
Make a wish.

15:28.172 --> 15:30.073
What did you wish for?

15:30.107 --> 15:31.474
This.

15:34.545 --> 15:37.914
You used me just so
you could date my sister!

15:37.948 --> 15:39.883
Oh, my God! Chris?!

15:39.917 --> 15:41.217
I'm so sorry!

15:41.251 --> 15:43.018
Oh, what have I done?!

15:43.053 --> 15:45.087
Aw, crap.

15:45.121 --> 15:46.722
Okay, Dad, you got us in.

15:46.756 --> 15:48.557
Now just go.

15:53.396 --> 15:55.363
Cleveland,
what are you looking at?

15:55.398 --> 15:56.732
I'm on edge.

15:56.766 --> 15:58.700
Saw <i>Halloween II</i>
last night.

15:58.734 --> 15:59.867
Brian, go outside.

15:59.902 --> 16:01.368
Keep guard
for Michael Myers.

16:01.403 --> 16:03.537
If he seem like he
dead, he ain't dead!

16:03.572 --> 16:04.939
Boy, Peter, seems like

16:04.973 --> 16:06.774
that obedience school
did wonders for Brian.

16:06.809 --> 16:08.176
Oh, yeah, it's great.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.144
He'll do anything
I tell him to now.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.645
Maybe I should
send Bonnie.

16:16.450 --> 16:18.384
Oh. Oh, my!

16:20.688 --> 16:22.355
All right, somebody
say something else.

16:22.389 --> 16:25.125
No. You need to know
what you did.

16:29.097 --> 16:30.330
Hey, Brian, you know...

16:30.364 --> 16:31.698
you know what we should do?

16:31.733 --> 16:33.933
Let's you and me go pee
in Meg's bed.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.735
That's-that's always fun.

16:35.769 --> 16:37.069
Pee in her bed?

16:37.104 --> 16:38.938
I-I... I could never do that.

16:38.972 --> 16:40.906
That-that... that'd be
peeing in the house,

16:40.941 --> 16:42.407
and that's-that's...
that's bad dog stuff.

16:42.442 --> 16:44.110
That-that's not good dog stuff!

16:44.144 --> 16:46.278
Wait. What?
What are you talking about?

16:46.312 --> 16:48.748
Forgive me for speaking
out of turn, sir,

16:48.782 --> 16:51.216
but you sent me to that
school to change me.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.951
It was your turn,
wasn't it?

16:52.985 --> 16:54.953
First, I went,
and you went?

16:54.987 --> 16:56.621
We best get you
to bed, sir.

16:56.655 --> 16:58.422
Oh, come on, Brian.
It's still early.

16:58.457 --> 17:00.625
Let's just... let's go throw
potatoes at Cleveland's house.

17:00.659 --> 17:01.726
You go ahead.

17:01.761 --> 17:03.494
I've got to go make
the waffle fries

17:03.528 --> 17:06.164
that you scream-requested
in the car.

17:06.198 --> 17:08.498
Geez, what the hell
happened to him?

17:08.532 --> 17:12.136
We used to be so close,
but now we seem so different.

17:12.170 --> 17:13.403
Like a whale

17:13.437 --> 17:16.339
and his developmentally-disabled
brother.

17:20.245 --> 17:21.812
Hi, guys!

17:23.047 --> 17:26.415
Get in my mouth,
you hundreds of fish.

17:29.953 --> 17:33.555
A record crowd
of 65 people turned out

17:33.590 --> 17:35.324
for Free Jerky Stick Night.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.426
Hey, that sounds
pretty good to me.

17:37.460 --> 17:39.428
Traffic on 146 is backed up
all the way

17:39.462 --> 17:40.429
to Mineral Spring Avenue...

17:40.463 --> 17:42.430
What do you want, Neil?

17:42.464 --> 17:44.299
And why are you
playing the news?

17:44.333 --> 17:45.667
Oh, it's an old boom box.

17:45.701 --> 17:46.968
I don't own any cassettes,

17:47.003 --> 17:49.304
so I just have to play
whatever's on the radio.

17:49.338 --> 17:51.372
Shouldn't you be out with Meg?

17:51.407 --> 17:54.009
Look, Chris,
I-I'm sorry I lied to you,

17:54.043 --> 17:56.878
but I'd still like
to be friends, and I hope...

17:56.913 --> 17:59.213
I'm sorry.
I have to put the boom box down.

17:59.247 --> 18:01.148
The D batteries
make it very heavy.

18:01.183 --> 18:02.582
Neil! There you are!

18:02.617 --> 18:04.285
What the hell
is your problem?!

18:04.319 --> 18:05.820
I finally give
you a shot,

18:05.854 --> 18:07.988
and you abandon me
in a movie theater?!

18:15.595 --> 18:17.096
I'm sorry, Meg,

18:17.131 --> 18:19.699
but my friendship
with Chris is more important.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.268
You're a jerk, Neil!

18:22.303 --> 18:23.903
So what do you say, Chris?

18:23.938 --> 18:25.404
Can we hang out again?

18:25.439 --> 18:28.341
Yeah. I'd like that, Neil.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.576
Great. See you tomorrow.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.919
This is 'cause I'm drunk!

18:40.954 --> 18:43.222
Move out, Irish trash!

18:48.527 --> 18:50.962
Hey, Lois, you noticed
ever since Brian came back

18:50.996 --> 18:53.331
from obedience school
that things have been weird?

18:53.365 --> 18:54.866
What do you mean?

18:54.900 --> 18:56.767
Well, he just lets me
order him around,

18:56.801 --> 18:59.403
and he-he never wants to do
fun stuff together like before.

18:59.437 --> 19:01.739
I mean, the thing I always
loved about Brian was

19:01.773 --> 19:03.807
that he wasn't just a pet.

19:03.842 --> 19:04.976
He was a friend.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.277
And I miss that friend.

19:07.311 --> 19:10.480
I think we just have to accept
that this is how he is now.

19:10.514 --> 19:12.282
Don't forget,
he bit you, Peter.

19:12.316 --> 19:14.117
I mean, what if he bit Stewie?

19:14.151 --> 19:15.952
How about
you bite me, bitch?

19:15.987 --> 19:17.553
Wait a minute. You're right!

19:17.588 --> 19:19.422
He bit me!

19:19.456 --> 19:21.424
I know what I got to do.

19:22.593 --> 19:24.459
I'm sorry.
Was that too harsh?

19:24.494 --> 19:26.728
It sounded more
playful in my head.

19:33.836 --> 19:35.204
I'm sorry, Brian,

19:35.238 --> 19:37.806
but I'm doing this in
the name of friendship.

19:43.045 --> 19:45.346
Ah, damn it!
What the hell, Peter?!

19:45.381 --> 19:47.382
Oh, my God.

19:47.416 --> 19:49.017
Oh, my God, I bit you!

19:49.051 --> 19:50.285
I'm-I'm so sorry, sir!

19:50.319 --> 19:52.120
No, no, no, it's
okay! It's okay!

19:52.154 --> 19:53.454
Don't you see, Brian?

19:53.488 --> 19:54.789
That's the
appropriate response

19:54.823 --> 19:56.457
if anyone gets
near your anus.

19:56.491 --> 19:59.059
Look, we were wrong
to try to change you.

19:59.093 --> 20:00.961
I-I just want
the old you back.

20:00.995 --> 20:02.296
You do?

20:02.330 --> 20:04.298
But-but I was a bad dog.

20:04.332 --> 20:06.866
I know, but that's what I
liked about you, you know?

20:06.901 --> 20:09.436
You were fun, we got into
trouble together, we got...

20:09.470 --> 20:11.838
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I just rubbed
my eye with this finger.

20:11.872 --> 20:13.573
Am I gonna be okay?
Am I gonna be okay?

20:13.607 --> 20:14.807
Wait, how do
you get pinkeye?

20:14.841 --> 20:16.442
Oh, God, this has
got to be it.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.979
Peter, I want things back
the way they were, too.

20:20.013 --> 20:21.380
That's what I want!

20:21.415 --> 20:23.649
Look, I'm really sorry
I bit you.

20:23.683 --> 20:24.883
Oh, forget all that.

20:24.918 --> 20:27.486
I'm just happy
to have my best friend back.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.721
I missed you, Brian.

20:29.756 --> 20:33.291
I've missed you, too, Peter.

20:33.326 --> 20:35.293
Welcome back, buddy.

20:35.328 --> 20:41.828
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

20:44.036 --> 20:46.838
And now I'm gonna go upstairs
and pee in Meg's bed.

20:46.872 --> 20:48.072
No.

20:48.106 --> 20:50.240
<i>We're</i> gonna go pee
in Meg's bed.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.576
Good boy.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.044
Hey, what's up?

20:54.079 --> 20:56.480
I didn't know we could do finger
stuff in the public rooms.
