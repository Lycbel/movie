We now return
<i><i>to<i> Hard Knocks CFL:</i></i></i>

00:35.588 --> 00:38.122
<i>Training Camp</i>
<i>with the Toronto Argonauts.</i>

00:38.157 --> 00:39.289
I hope you make it.

00:39.325 --> 00:40.457
You're real good.

00:40.493 --> 00:41.959
No way, not as
good as you.

00:41.994 --> 00:43.127
I hope you make it.

00:43.162 --> 00:44.795
What're you gonna do
with all your money?

00:44.830 --> 00:45.963
Oh, probably
just save it.

00:45.998 --> 00:47.464
Yeah, that's
real smart.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.366
Well, back
to my book.

00:49.401 --> 00:51.535
Peter, I was at the park
with Stewie,

00:51.570 --> 00:53.537
and someone stole
his tricycle.

00:53.572 --> 00:55.038
And during, like,
the one second

00:55.074 --> 00:57.307
I was looking down at my phone
and not at him.

00:57.343 --> 00:58.742
Stupid thief.

00:58.777 --> 01:01.145
It's got a vanity plate
that won't even apply to him.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.312
Hey.

01:02.348 --> 01:04.314
You like your reggae
watered down

01:04.350 --> 01:05.649
and acceptable
at a wedding?

01:05.684 --> 01:07.151
Hop on.

01:07.186 --> 01:09.820
Ugh, can't believe somebody
stole Stewie's trike.

01:09.855 --> 01:11.989
I only had nine payments
left on that thing.

01:12.024 --> 01:13.323
How much do you make?

01:13.359 --> 01:15.325
Don't worry, Lois, I'm
gonna find that tricycle.

01:15.361 --> 01:18.495
I'll just have four to five
beers to stop the shaking,

01:18.531 --> 01:20.097
and then I'll
go outside.

01:24.470 --> 01:27.104
Huh, never seen that kid
around the neighborhood.

01:27.139 --> 01:28.872
Maybe he's got something
to do with it.

01:28.908 --> 01:30.374
Hey, kid.

01:30.409 --> 01:31.729
You know anything
about a tricycle

01:31.744 --> 01:33.210
that just got stolen
from the park?

01:33.245 --> 01:34.545
No, sir, I've been
sitting here

01:34.580 --> 01:36.547
for the last three hours
selling lemonade.

01:36.582 --> 01:38.048
Would you like
an ice-cold glass?

01:38.083 --> 01:40.884
Why, sure.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.053
You couldn't have been here
for three hours on this,

01:43.088 --> 01:44.388
the hottest day
of the year,

01:44.423 --> 01:46.557
or the ice cubes in your
pitcher would have melted.

01:46.592 --> 01:47.624
Ow...

01:47.660 --> 01:49.060
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:49.094 --> 01:50.094
Anything you say...

01:50.095 --> 01:51.562
Peter, Peter! We
can't arrest him.

01:51.597 --> 01:52.896
If anything, they
can arrest you.

01:52.932 --> 01:54.898
Hey, here's
the tricycle.

01:54.934 --> 01:56.400
You were right,
Peter.

01:56.435 --> 01:57.734
This kid's a thief.

01:57.770 --> 01:58.770
We did it!

01:58.771 --> 01:59.903
Wow, look at us.

01:59.939 --> 02:01.905
Hey, you know,
we make a great team, guys.

02:01.941 --> 02:03.574
Like Huey Lewis
and the Jews.

02:03.609 --> 02:05.576
♪ We don't
need money... ♪

02:05.611 --> 02:07.277
Sorry, the band's
breaking up.

02:09.982 --> 02:11.615
Here you go, Stewie.

02:11.650 --> 02:12.950
Don't bother sniffing
the seat.

02:12.985 --> 02:14.318
It don't smell
like nothing.

02:14.353 --> 02:15.485
Oh, yeah, my trike.

02:15.521 --> 02:16.987
Eh, I'm kind of
over that thing.

02:17.022 --> 02:20.991
Now I'm way into wooden
beads you move along wires.

02:21.026 --> 02:22.326
Whoa...

02:22.361 --> 02:24.494
Oh, yeah...

02:24.530 --> 02:26.830
Boy, when you find
a baby's tricycle,

02:26.865 --> 02:28.665
it feels like there's
nothing you can't do.

02:28.701 --> 02:30.334
Man, I wish we
could quit our jobs

02:30.369 --> 02:32.669
and solve children's
crimes full-time.

02:32.705 --> 02:34.671
I heard you guys are
good at solving cases.

02:34.707 --> 02:37.507
I'll give you 50 cents to
find my lucky baseball card.

02:37.543 --> 02:39.676
Guys, we're
in business.

02:41.146 --> 02:43.780
Oh, wait a minute, I didn't
notice you have a pierced ear.

02:43.816 --> 02:44.948
We can't help you.

02:44.984 --> 02:46.450
You go home
and tell your mother

02:46.485 --> 02:48.685
she's supposed to be
a parent, not a friend.

02:53.392 --> 02:55.192
All right, guys, this'll be
the headquarters

02:55.227 --> 02:57.194
for our new
detective agency.

02:57.229 --> 02:59.129
This milk crate
will be my chair,

02:59.164 --> 03:01.331
this overturned rain barrel
will be my desk,

03:01.367 --> 03:03.166
and this DNA evidence
centrifuge

03:03.202 --> 03:05.636
and fingerprint scanner
will be my coatrack.

03:05.671 --> 03:07.638
Piece of junk.

03:07.673 --> 03:10.641
I guess all our detective
agency needs now is a name.

03:10.676 --> 03:13.310
Well, we're detectives
solving children's crimes.

03:13.345 --> 03:14.978
There's only one name
that makes sense.

03:15.014 --> 03:16.647
"Dicks for Kids"?
"Dicks for Kids."

03:16.682 --> 03:18.982
But wait, we want people
to know<i> we're</i> grown-ups.

03:19.018 --> 03:20.651
Okay, "Big Dicks
For Kids."

03:20.686 --> 03:22.319
But we don't want
to sound too old.

03:22.354 --> 03:24.821
They're gonna think we're a
bunch of old, bald geezers.

03:24.857 --> 03:26.323
"Big Hairy Dicks
for Kids."

03:26.358 --> 03:29.326
How are we gonna let them
know we're "veiny"?

03:31.797 --> 03:34.097
So, you say this gumball machine
took your dime

03:34.133 --> 03:35.432
and didn't give you
a gumball?

03:35.467 --> 03:36.467
That's right.

03:36.468 --> 03:37.768
Well, I'll take care
of that.

03:37.803 --> 03:39.770
Hand over the dime, buddy.

03:39.805 --> 03:40.937
Come on, hand it over.

03:40.973 --> 03:42.272
Don't make this
hard on yourself.

03:42.308 --> 03:43.607
Wait a minute.

03:43.642 --> 03:45.742
This gumball machine
takes quarters, not dimes.

03:47.112 --> 03:48.412
Holy crap, it's a setup.

03:48.447 --> 03:49.946
Time to make a quick getaway.

03:56.755 --> 03:58.221
You were set up,
too, huh?

03:58.257 --> 03:59.556
Yeah.

03:59.591 --> 04:03.727
You realize that kid is plowing
both our wives right now.

04:05.764 --> 04:07.097
So what do we got
today, boys?

04:07.132 --> 04:09.466
Well, it seems like we got
a bit of a crime spree.

04:09.501 --> 04:11.468
Just this morning,
we've had multiple reports

04:11.503 --> 04:12.803
of stolen items.

04:12.838 --> 04:16.473
Uh, couple marbles, ball
of yarn, two Wiffle ball bats.

04:16.508 --> 04:20.877
Someday a rain'll come and wash
all this scum off the streets.

04:20.913 --> 04:23.380
Guys, I think I've got a
lead on all these thefts.

04:23.415 --> 04:26.049
One of the kids had
a nanny-cam hidden in his room.

04:28.921 --> 04:31.888
Come on, let's do it
on your son's tiny bed.

04:31.924 --> 04:33.757
Hurry, he gets home
at 3:00.

04:33.792 --> 04:35.092
Okay, it's later than this.

04:35.127 --> 04:36.927
Y-Yeah,
f-fast-forward ahead.

04:36.962 --> 04:37.962
Forward. Forward.

04:37.963 --> 04:38.963
Keep forwarding.

04:38.964 --> 04:40.263
Is that woman
gonna be okay?

04:40.299 --> 04:41.299
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.766
We're having brunch
after this.

04:42.801 --> 04:45.102
God, I look huge
in that bed, don't I?

04:45.137 --> 04:46.770
You think other
guys hang out

04:46.805 --> 04:49.773
and watch their friend's
naked gyrating butt?

04:49.808 --> 04:52.776
It's been so long, I don't
know what other friends do.

04:52.811 --> 04:54.778
Forwarding, forwarding,
forwarding...

04:54.813 --> 04:55.946
And there we go.

04:55.981 --> 04:57.013
Our thief.

05:01.653 --> 05:03.954
Chris Gaines was Garth Brooks.

05:03.989 --> 05:05.789
I just figured that out.

05:08.327 --> 05:10.994
Oh, my God, Chris stole
all that stuff.

05:11.029 --> 05:12.496
No way,
he wouldn't do that.

05:12.531 --> 05:13.830
Peter, Chris is
on the tape.

05:13.866 --> 05:15.165
We got to search
his bedroom.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.500
Fine, go ahead.

05:16.535 --> 05:19.002
But I'm telling you, it's gonna
be a bigger waste of time

05:19.037 --> 05:21.138
than writing tough-guy dialogue
for a Jet Li movie.

05:31.417 --> 05:33.049
This is your
last warning.

05:33.085 --> 05:34.384
Give me back my wife.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.052
What? Excuse me?

05:36.088 --> 05:38.555
Give me back my wife, or
you're in a lot of trouble.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.723
I'll kick all
your faces.

05:39.758 --> 05:40.891
You got me?

05:40.926 --> 05:42.893
You're kind of undoing
everything you just did

05:42.928 --> 05:44.060
when you kicked
my ass.

05:44.096 --> 05:46.630
I know, but I have
to say for audience.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.473
Chris still has
an Aaron Hernandez poster up?

05:56.508 --> 05:58.041
That's not cool.

05:59.945 --> 06:01.411
See, there's nothing here.

06:01.447 --> 06:03.246
Just a weird life-sized
lady doll

06:03.282 --> 06:05.182
made out of all the stuff
that got stolen.

06:07.953 --> 06:09.252
No!

06:09.288 --> 06:10.420
Don't hurt Heather.

06:10.456 --> 06:11.755
Don't hurt my girlfriend.

06:11.790 --> 06:12.923
What the hell?!

06:12.958 --> 06:14.424
Chris made
a sex doll?!

06:14.460 --> 06:16.426
Your kid's got
a walk-in closet?

06:16.462 --> 06:18.528
Two of mine gotta sleep
in the car.

06:23.863 --> 06:25.330
Chris is still
in his room

06:25.365 --> 06:27.332
with that disgusting
homemade sex doll.

06:27.367 --> 06:29.534
He actually thinks
it's his girlfriend.

06:29.569 --> 06:31.035
I know, it's weird.

06:31.071 --> 06:33.938
It's even weirder than that
secret level in<i> Donkey Kong.</i>

06:58.865 --> 07:00.865
♪ ♪

07:21.321 --> 07:23.354
♪ ♪

07:46.613 --> 07:49.247
Maybe it's our fault Chris
has such a screwed-up idea

07:49.282 --> 07:51.249
about what
a relationship is.

07:51.284 --> 07:52.583
I mean,
let's be honest,

07:52.619 --> 07:54.585
we're not exactly the model
of a healthy marriage.

07:54.621 --> 07:57.255
Oh, boy, is this 'cause of
the time I pushed off of you

07:57.290 --> 07:58.923
after sex and
bruised your boob?

07:58.958 --> 08:01.859
No, I-I mean, when was the
last time you bought me flowers,

08:01.895 --> 08:03.695
or-or we had
a date night?

08:03.730 --> 08:05.029
We do stuff.

08:05.065 --> 08:06.864
Just last week, I let
you watch me complain

08:06.900 --> 08:08.733
after eating too
many hot wings.

08:08.768 --> 08:10.068
Ugh!

08:10.103 --> 08:12.737
Why did you let me
do this, Lois?!

08:12.772 --> 08:14.072
Why?!

08:14.107 --> 08:17.208
Okay, Peter, I got to take
the kids to school now.

08:21.881 --> 08:23.014
Hey, Chris,

08:23.049 --> 08:25.016
your mother wanted me
to talk to you.

08:25.051 --> 08:27.018
Um, she doesn't think
it's healthy for you

08:27.053 --> 08:29.353
to be spending all your time
with a homemade sex doll.

08:29.389 --> 08:30.389
Sex doll?

08:30.390 --> 08:31.689
I wish.

08:31.725 --> 08:33.691
Heather hasn't even let
me get to second base.

08:33.727 --> 08:34.859
Wh... H-Hang on.

08:34.894 --> 08:36.194
What's second base?

08:36.229 --> 08:38.029
Is that touching
one of the cabbages?

08:38.064 --> 08:39.530
Yeah.

08:39.566 --> 08:42.700
But I'm such a loser,
she'll never let me do that.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.869
Come on, Chris,
don't sell yourself short.

08:44.904 --> 08:47.305
You are every bit as good
as that bag of garbage.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.473
You really think so?

08:48.508 --> 08:49.807
Sure, I do.

08:49.843 --> 08:52.477
And look, if you really want
to learn how to bang that thing,

08:52.512 --> 08:54.312
there's no better teacher
than your old dad.

08:54.347 --> 08:56.481
After all, I'm the guy
who taught old Asian people

08:56.516 --> 08:57.815
how to get
on the subway.

09:00.186 --> 09:01.552
Out of the way!

09:01.588 --> 09:03.554
Nobody else matters!

09:03.590 --> 09:04.889
All right,
you made it.

09:04.924 --> 09:07.225
Now twirl that long hair
sticking out of your face mole.

09:07.260 --> 09:09.727
And cough-- cough like
you never coughed before.

09:15.969 --> 09:19.103
Okay, Chris, now, women really
dig those firemen calendars.

09:19.139 --> 09:21.439
So we're gonna go inside

if we never take it

09:52.572 --> 09:54.205
to the next level,
physically.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.908
I just really like
spending time with you.

10:00.079 --> 10:01.546
Wow.

10:01.581 --> 10:04.615
I'm gonna have to write
to somebody about this.

"Dear Penthouse,

these letters were fake

10:07.821 --> 10:10.621
"until my taped-together,
soccer-ball-headed girlfriend

10:10.657 --> 10:12.123
fell in my lap."

10:12.158 --> 10:14.625
Hey, do we still have
a magazine?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.999
Good morning, everybody.

10:22.035 --> 10:24.168
I think Heather will be
eating breakfast

10:24.204 --> 10:27.738
standing up this morning,
if you know what I mean.

10:27.774 --> 10:30.308
Peter, I thought you were
gonna take care of this.

10:30.343 --> 10:31.943
You were supposed to make
Chris get rid of that doll.

10:31.978 --> 10:33.945
I did take care of it.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.460
He slept with it,
and now he'll slowly

10:35.481 --> 10:37.448
grow to hate it
over the next 20 years.

10:37.483 --> 10:38.616
This is all your fault.

10:38.651 --> 10:40.418
You never listen
to anything I say.

10:40.453 --> 10:41.819
Look, you told me
to talk to him.

10:41.855 --> 10:42.855
I talked to him.

10:42.889 --> 10:44.288
And now you're
nagging me about it?

10:44.324 --> 10:47.592
God, you're more annoying than
a creative voice mail message.

Oh, Lois, thank God!

11:27.267 --> 11:29.767
Listen, I can't decide what
I want for breakfast tomorrow.

11:29.802 --> 11:31.369
Can you make me a sample tray?

11:31.404 --> 11:32.470
You know what, Peter?

11:32.505 --> 11:33.704
I'm not talking
to you right now.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.206
You screwed up
bad with Chris.

11:35.241 --> 11:36.607
And you still
haven't apologized

11:36.643 --> 11:38.109
for the way you
treated me earlier.

11:38.144 --> 11:40.344
Aw, come on, Lois.
I'll make it up to you.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.146
Maybe sooner than you know.

11:45.218 --> 11:46.617
Oh, Peter!

11:46.653 --> 11:48.185
They're beautiful!

11:48.221 --> 11:50.288
You're such a sweetheart.

11:50.323 --> 11:51.489
Read the card.

11:51.524 --> 11:53.891
"To Heather, from Chris"?

11:53.927 --> 11:56.627
Oh, I thought it might
have a funny riddle on it.

11:56.663 --> 11:58.829
Oh, good, the flowers came!

11:58.865 --> 12:01.165
We're just cocooning today
because Heather said

12:01.200 --> 12:02.600
she's never seen TV.

12:02.635 --> 12:05.369
So, we're starting with
season six of<i> Becker.</i>

12:05.405 --> 12:08.806
I'm just gonna be
easing her in.

12:08.841 --> 12:10.141
Lois, before you say anything.

12:10.176 --> 12:12.810
I also got<i> you</i> a gift.

12:12.845 --> 12:15.446
It's a Katherine Heigl mask for
you to wear while we have sex.

12:15.481 --> 12:17.748
She's perfect, because
she's only sort of hot,

12:17.784 --> 12:19.850
so there won't be this crazy
disconnect of her face

12:19.886 --> 12:22.386
on your body, which would
totally take me out of it.

12:22.422 --> 12:25.089
Also, it's designed so you
can wear it on your butt.

12:25.124 --> 12:27.158
Heather, I made
your favorite cookies.

12:27.193 --> 12:29.927
And now I want to hear
all about your day.

12:29.963 --> 12:33.664
Hey, Lois, I heard Katherine
Heigl likes to French kiss.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.033
Oh, my God!

12:36.069 --> 12:40.004
Chris treats that pile of junk
better than Peter treats me!

12:40.039 --> 12:41.605
What's the matter, Lois?
Need to get in the mood?

12:41.641 --> 12:45.242
How about a little
help from Kenny G?

♪ ♪

12:58.858 --> 13:02.126
I wonder if Cleveland's
gonna want his sax back.

13:07.528 --> 13:08.660
Oh, hi, Chris.

13:08.696 --> 13:09.862
Where have you been?

13:09.897 --> 13:11.864
Heather and I went
for a tandem bike ride.

13:11.899 --> 13:13.932
And then had lunch
at a gastropube.

13:13.968 --> 13:15.400
Nope.

13:15.436 --> 13:16.869
Huh. Sounds like fun.

13:16.904 --> 13:18.570
What have you guys been up to?

13:18.606 --> 13:21.373
Your father got a DVD of black
people fighting in the street.

13:21.408 --> 13:22.841
It's not just
in the street.

13:22.877 --> 13:24.910
Some of them are in
private residences.

13:24.945 --> 13:27.846
Oh. Well, tomorrow, Heather
and I are going to the park

13:27.882 --> 13:29.515
to picnic and fly kites.

13:29.550 --> 13:31.783
And on Saturday,
she's hosting her book club,

13:31.819 --> 13:33.819
so I have to drop by,
say something funny,

13:33.854 --> 13:35.787
and then stay upstairs.

13:35.823 --> 13:38.624
Wow, your plans sound
very sweet and romantic, Chris.

13:38.659 --> 13:41.026
And how a man
should treat his woman.

13:41.061 --> 13:42.581
Oh, Lois, your breath
smells like eggs.

13:42.596 --> 13:45.464
Talk that way.

13:45.499 --> 13:47.633
Chris, when you go on your
picnic tomorrow,

13:47.668 --> 13:50.402
c-can your father
and I come with you?

13:50.437 --> 13:52.471
Let me just ask Heather.

13:52.506 --> 13:54.773
I know, but I think we better.

13:54.808 --> 13:57.075
Apparently the cancer's
already in his bones.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.578
What?
We'd love to, sounds great!

14:01.048 --> 14:02.080
What are you doing?
You can't let him

14:02.116 --> 14:03.849
keep thinking
that doll is real.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.285
I know. But I just
want Peter to see

14:06.320 --> 14:08.320
what a thoughtful man looks
like for one afternoon.

14:08.322 --> 14:10.789
Maybe he'll learn something.

14:10.824 --> 14:12.057
Are you sure about this?

14:12.092 --> 14:13.492
It seems pretty extreme.

14:13.527 --> 14:15.060
Well, I got to try something.

14:15.095 --> 14:16.762
Peter and I used
to be so close.

14:16.797 --> 14:19.364
But now we're like
apples and oranges.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.934
People say we're different, but
we're really not that different.

14:21.969 --> 14:23.769
Mm-hmm, yeah, we
both work in marketing.

14:23.804 --> 14:25.204
We've both lost children.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.306
We both own cars, but
we like to take the bus.

14:27.341 --> 14:29.074
And we both cheat
at Words With Friends.

14:29.109 --> 14:30.409
Oh, nice try!

14:30.444 --> 14:31.577
I certainly do not!

14:31.612 --> 14:33.478
And we're both gonna
have a moderate time

14:33.514 --> 14:34.813
at the party tonight.

14:34.848 --> 14:36.548
And we're not gonna count
each other's drinks.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.985
We won't have to
because we won't be drinking.

14:44.024 --> 14:47.492
Wow, it sure is fun going
on a picnic, isn't it, Peter?

14:47.528 --> 14:48.827
Yeah. Will you hold
this beer bottle

14:48.862 --> 14:51.163
while I try to kick
the top off it?

14:51.198 --> 14:52.264

15:27.901 --> 15:30.969
None of your business
how much it was.

15:31.005 --> 15:32.504
He bought her a scarf.

15:32.539 --> 15:34.339
And it actually goes well
with her colors.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.541
Peter, don't you see
what's going on here?!

15:36.577 --> 15:38.477
Your son's relationship
with that doll

15:38.512 --> 15:40.445
is better than our own marriage!

15:40.481 --> 15:42.281
Peter?

15:42.316 --> 15:45.584
Hey, can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?

16:10.711 --> 16:12.377
My morning scream.

16:14.882 --> 16:16.815
Heather's gone!

16:16.850 --> 16:18.717
Mom! Heather's disappeared!

16:18.752 --> 16:20.085
Have you seen her?!

16:20.120 --> 16:21.720
No, I haven't, sweetheart.

16:21.755 --> 16:22.921
B-But you know what?

16:22.956 --> 16:25.657
Sometimes relationships
run their course

16:25.693 --> 16:27.626
and come to a natural end.

16:27.661 --> 16:30.429
This could be a sign
that it's time to move on.

16:30.464 --> 16:32.964
Aw, and I just helped him
pick out that scarf.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.599
I miss her so much.

16:34.635 --> 16:35.934
I know, honey.

16:35.969 --> 16:37.736
But if you give it
a little time,

16:37.771 --> 16:39.404
I'm sure you'll get over her.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.874
Just like you got over your
Hamster Dance Tourette Syndrome.

Hey, Chris.

17:07.368 --> 17:08.867
I-I see you're sad.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.569
And also sitting
on the remote.

17:10.604 --> 17:13.071
Why did Heather leave me?!

17:13.107 --> 17:15.741
I don't know, but sometimes
when life's got you down,

17:15.776 --> 17:18.009
you-you got to stand
up for a second.

17:18.045 --> 17:19.344

17:19.380 --> 17:21.947

17:21.982 --> 17:24.683
Aw, looks like somebody
could use a hug.

17:30.124 --> 17:31.256
Here we go.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.691
Oh, no, I hit input!

17:32.726 --> 17:34.426
Oh, no! Oh, God!

17:34.461 --> 17:35.794
We may have to throw
away the television.

17:35.829 --> 17:37.729
What should I do, Dad?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.297
I don't know. Hey, where's
that girlfriend of yours?

17:39.333 --> 17:41.299
She seems cool.

17:45.272 --> 17:49.007
This day has Haagen-Dazs
written all over it.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.379
Boy, he's really upset.

17:54.415 --> 17:55.680
I can't
deal with anything

17:55.716 --> 17:57.249
until I've had my
after-nap coffee.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.687
I don't think guys should have
two hands on a coffee mug ever.

18:02.723 --> 18:04.723
What?

18:04.758 --> 18:06.391
Mmm, oh, yummy.

18:06.427 --> 18:07.726
Don't do that, either.

18:07.761 --> 18:09.895
J-Just-just don't do anything.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.769
Hey, Chris.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.272
I see you turned your hat around
so you can really get in there.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.307
Oh, what do you care?

18:22.342 --> 18:24.342
What does anybody care?

18:24.378 --> 18:25.710
Why don't you come with me?

18:25.746 --> 18:27.612
I-I've got something
to show you.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.581
If it's the shot from<i> Psycho</i>
where you can see

18:29.616 --> 18:32.417
Anne Heche's bunghole,
I've already seen it.

18:32.453 --> 18:34.319
No, Chris, it's
something else.

18:34.354 --> 18:36.988
Come on.

18:50.804 --> 18:53.572
Heather? Oh, my God!

18:53.607 --> 18:54.706
I'm sorry, Chris.

18:54.741 --> 18:57.175
You-you did this?

18:57.211 --> 18:58.543
I did.

18:58.579 --> 19:01.146
I took your doll
because it's not a natural

19:01.181 --> 19:03.815
or healthy thing for a boy
your age to have.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.051
It looks like
you stabbed her.

19:06.086 --> 19:08.420
Like, 50 times.

19:08.455 --> 19:11.656
I was kind of jealous of it, so
I guess I went a little crazy.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.125
Also, her lipstick
is all smeared.

19:14.161 --> 19:16.828
I was having a lot
of strange feelings!

19:16.864 --> 19:19.865
Look, Chris, I'm sorry.
You can have Heather back.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.467
But I just want you to know,
if you ever treat a real woman

19:22.503 --> 19:24.402
the way you treat that doll,

19:24.438 --> 19:27.272
you're gonna make her
very happy.

19:27.307 --> 19:28.473
Really?

19:28.509 --> 19:29.774
Absolutely.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.978
And I know she'll make you
very happy, too.

19:33.013 --> 19:35.413
You know... I don't think

19:35.449 --> 19:37.782
I need Heather anymore.

19:37.818 --> 19:39.451
You don't?
No.

19:39.486 --> 19:41.152
I'm glad to hear
that, Chris.

19:41.188 --> 19:43.522
Seems like maybe
you're growing up.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.190
Maybe.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.865
I guess there's just
one thing left to do.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.926
What's that?

19:47.961 --> 19:49.027
Give me that knife.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.195
I got to cut out the baby.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.230
Oh, my God!

19:51.265 --> 19:53.098
It's made of Skittles.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.834
You want to eat the baby
together on the way home?

19:55.869 --> 19:59.371
Yeah, I'd like that, Chris.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.822
You know, Lois, I've been
thinking about what you said.

20:17.858 --> 20:19.958
And I did learn
a little something

20:19.993 --> 20:21.927
from watching
Chris and Heather.

20:21.962 --> 20:23.295
You did?
Yeah.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.063
From now on, I am gonna be

20:25.098 --> 20:27.866
treating you like garbage.

20:27.901 --> 20:30.001
Oh, Peter. Thank you.

20:30.037 --> 20:31.970
I love you, Lois.

20:32.005 --> 20:33.405
Mom? Dad?

20:33.440 --> 20:36.441
I want you to meet
my new girlfriend!

20:36.476 --> 20:38.009
This is Mistress Vita.

20:38.045 --> 20:39.711
We met on Craigslist.

20:39.746 --> 20:42.380
