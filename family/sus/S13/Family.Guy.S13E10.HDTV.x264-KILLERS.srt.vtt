@elder_man

00:33.465 --> 00:35.933
Hey Lois, can I please
have another pancake?

00:35.968 --> 00:37.901
What? What's so funny?

00:37.937 --> 00:39.603
I don't know.
Dog eating pancakes.

00:39.638 --> 00:40.838
It's funny.

00:40.873 --> 00:43.307
Mom, I need a check
for the school field trip.

00:43.342 --> 00:45.676
Geez, Meg, didn't I just
take you on a field trip?

00:47.046 --> 00:48.779
Okay, here's the field!
Good-bye forever!

00:51.417 --> 00:53.517
Aah! Meg, I'm injured!

00:53.552 --> 00:55.085
Please help me!

00:55.120 --> 00:57.020
I smell gas!

00:58.757 --> 01:02.226
Meg, I'm still alive,
but I'm badly burned!

01:02.261 --> 01:05.529
Come save my life and
nurse me back to health!

01:05.564 --> 01:10.200
Oh, God, why do bad things
happen to good people?!

01:10.236 --> 01:11.835
Here, sweetie, I'll
write you a check.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.237
No, no, I got it, Lois.

01:13.272 --> 01:14.671
Let me just lick my thumb

01:14.707 --> 01:18.108
'cause that's what people do
before they write a check.

01:18.143 --> 01:21.979
Okay, now let me tilt my glasses
down and ask the date.

01:22.014 --> 01:24.348
What's the date today?

01:24.383 --> 01:26.750
Dad, why don't your checks
have any writing on them?

01:26.785 --> 01:28.886
Why don't your shelves
have any trophies on 'em?

01:28.921 --> 01:33.156
I've obviously
caught you at a bad time.

01:33.192 --> 01:35.225
Lois, why<i> don't</i> my checks
have any writing on them?

01:35.261 --> 01:37.294
Well, Peter...
What?

01:37.329 --> 01:40.898
That's just a wide pad
of Post-its I gave you.

01:42.568 --> 01:44.868
What?!
So that million dollar check

01:44.904 --> 01:46.637
you gave me yesterday
is no good?

01:46.672 --> 01:48.705
I quit my job, man!

01:48.741 --> 01:52.276
I will<i> not</i> see you Monday!

01:52.311 --> 01:53.443
What the hell, Lois?

01:53.479 --> 01:54.878
Why don't I have
a real checkbook?

01:54.914 --> 01:56.546
Peter, where do
checks come from?

01:56.582 --> 01:59.783
Uh... when a mommy and daddy
love each other?

01:59.818 --> 02:00.984
That's why.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.654
Lois, I want my own checkbook,
and I want it now!

02:03.689 --> 02:05.656
Ooh, I like
when Dad talks tough.

02:05.691 --> 02:07.457
He sounds like
Dirty Harry.

02:07.493 --> 02:09.359
You got to ask yourself
one question.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.328
"Do I feel lucky?"

02:11.363 --> 02:13.397
Well, do ya, punk?

02:13.432 --> 02:15.432
Oh, Mr. Harry,

02:15.467 --> 02:18.335
you're really not gonna like
what I have to say.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.441
Hi. What can I
do for you?

02:24.476 --> 02:26.209
Yes, I was wondering,
where is the room

02:26.245 --> 02:28.178
where I can roll around nude
with my money?

02:28.213 --> 02:29.346
I'm sorry?

02:29.381 --> 02:31.481
No, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a bank.

02:31.517 --> 02:32.849
I'll handle this.

02:32.885 --> 02:35.118
My husband wants to
open a checking account.

02:35.154 --> 02:37.487
Okay, well, first,
I'll need to see a photo I.D.

02:37.523 --> 02:38.722
and a birth certificate.

02:38.757 --> 02:39.923
Of course.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.426
I keep all my important
papers in my bosom.

02:43.996 --> 02:47.030
Okay, "Justin...
Peter... Griffin."

02:47.066 --> 02:48.966
It's actually
just Peter Griffin.

02:49.001 --> 02:52.703
So, this is not your
birth certificate?

02:54.907 --> 02:56.073
Oh, my God!

02:56.108 --> 02:57.708
Your first name
is Justin?!

02:57.743 --> 02:58.976
It is?!

02:59.011 --> 03:00.644
Wow, I never noticed that!

03:00.679 --> 03:02.279
"Justin Griffin."

03:02.314 --> 03:04.281
Huh, I like
the sound of that.

03:04.316 --> 03:05.615
I'm a Justin!

03:05.651 --> 03:07.751
This is awesome!
This changes everything!

03:07.786 --> 03:09.252
Peter, it doesn't
change a thing.

03:09.288 --> 03:11.088
You're still
the exact same person.

03:11.123 --> 03:13.557
I beg to differ.

03:17.463 --> 03:21.431

for park soccer.

03:35.647 --> 03:37.781
Peter, why the hell
do you look like that?

03:37.816 --> 03:39.016
Uh, my name
isn't Peter.

03:39.051 --> 03:40.317
My name is Justin.

03:40.352 --> 03:44.287
I'm living a Justin lifestyle,
and so is my family.

03:44.323 --> 03:46.289
You want to go to
a concert? Huh?

03:46.325 --> 03:48.225
Want to go to a
loud concert?

03:48.260 --> 03:49.526
No.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.395
Since I'm your cool
father Justin,

03:51.430 --> 03:53.730
we should bond with
skin-to-skin contact.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.432
How about Justin
takes his shirt off,

03:55.467 --> 03:58.301
and we can get some photos
of you on Justin's belly?

04:00.572 --> 04:02.205
Your heartbeat is weird.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.207
It is not
consistent at all.

04:04.243 --> 04:06.543
Okay, let's go for a
ride in my open Jeep.

04:06.578 --> 04:09.613
I took the doors off,
so it's extra terrifying.

04:09.648 --> 04:12.616
Geez, this "Justin" phase
of Dad's is kind of weird.

04:12.651 --> 04:15.585
Eh, not as weird as
his karaoke phase.

04:16.622 --> 04:18.588
Peter, did you throw up

Oh, hey, Chris.

05:37.903 --> 05:39.369
I just figured now
that I'm Justin,

05:39.404 --> 05:41.371
I should start
a "Sweet News" wall

05:41.406 --> 05:43.173
for stuff I think
is totally sweet.

05:43.208 --> 05:46.009
Big puffy clouds
are very sweet.

05:46.044 --> 05:47.044
Big hamburgers.

05:47.045 --> 05:48.345
Small hamburgers, too.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.013
Sliders, I think
they're called.

05:50.048 --> 05:51.181
Ranch.

05:51.216 --> 05:52.682
Here's just a
picture of a vest.

05:52.718 --> 05:54.017
Pretty sweet.

05:54.052 --> 05:57.187
Palm trees are very sweet,
'cause, like, the beach.

05:57.222 --> 05:58.855
This is<i> my</i> room, Dad.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.625
The band Guster is the
sweetest band of all time.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.628
It was tough, 'cause I had
to move all my O.A.R. stuff

06:04.663 --> 06:06.296
to fit the Guster stuff.

06:06.331 --> 06:08.031
Peter, get out
of Chris's room.

06:08.066 --> 06:09.199
Oh, hey Mama.

06:09.234 --> 06:10.934
Hey, you seen my copy
of<i> Into the Wild?</i>

06:10.969 --> 06:13.203
I like to have it on
my person at all times,

06:13.238 --> 06:15.038
in case I need a
quick "inspo sesh."

06:15.073 --> 06:17.707
Oh, did I tell you I'm gonna
be doing a lot of abbreve's?

06:17.743 --> 06:19.042
Peter, you sound
like an idiot.

06:19.077 --> 06:21.545
And did you put a skateboard
in the washing machine?

06:21.580 --> 06:23.713
It's gonna cost several
hundred dollars to repair.

06:23.749 --> 06:24.881
How we do, Lois.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.049
All we do.

06:26.084 --> 06:28.051
You ever get in the
pocket of a wave?

06:28.086 --> 06:29.386
Peter, you know
I haven't.

06:29.421 --> 06:31.221
And I know for a fact
that you haven't, either.

06:31.256 --> 06:32.256
In the pocket.

06:32.257 --> 06:33.723
Some gnarlies out there.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.058
Some "gnar-gnars."

06:35.093 --> 06:36.393
Was in one today.

06:36.428 --> 06:38.228
It's like the rest of
the world just shuts off,

06:38.263 --> 06:40.730
and all that matters
is you and Lady Blue.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.732
And you know what
she said to me?

06:42.768 --> 06:45.068
"You're great."

06:45.103 --> 06:46.403
Keep it cool, Lois.

06:46.438 --> 06:48.939
K-E-W-L.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.583
So, you want to
go upstairs?

06:59.618 --> 07:00.684
Sure.

07:00.719 --> 07:01.719
Great.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
Go.

07:04.089 --> 07:06.056
Hey, Justin, I wanted
to introduce you to Keira.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.391
She's the one who brought
four loose Sierra Nevadas.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.559
Keira!

07:09.595 --> 07:12.429
You totally rock
for bringing those.

07:12.464 --> 07:14.831
Peter, what the hell
is going on?!

07:14.866 --> 07:16.833
Oh, dude, is that your mom?

07:16.868 --> 07:18.835
No, I'm not his mom,
you little bastard.

07:18.870 --> 07:22.405
That "little bastard" knows how
to smoke pot out of an apple.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.441
All right,
everyone out of here.

07:27.012 --> 07:29.312
I've had enough of
this "Justin" nonsense.

07:29.348 --> 07:30.814
Tomorrow we're
going to city hall

07:30.849 --> 07:32.816
to legally change your
name back to "Peter."

07:32.851 --> 07:34.484
All right, fine.

07:34.519 --> 07:37.487
But I got to say, being Justin
was quite an adventure.

07:37.522 --> 07:39.956
Like when I found
where the Wild Things were.

07:44.329 --> 07:45.629
I owe you, Max.

07:45.664 --> 07:46.963
You led me right to 'em.

07:46.999 --> 07:50.133
All right, now help me grind
their horns into boner pills.

07:53.839 --> 07:56.306
Keira, that was
an amazing night.

07:56.341 --> 07:57.707
Sorry I can't
drive you to work.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.676
I gotta go sit in my
den until you leave.

07:59.711 --> 08:00.810
Oh, that's okay.

08:00.846 --> 08:02.145
I'll just take
the school bus.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.813
Wait... what?!

08:03.849 --> 08:05.815
You-you drive
a school bus?

08:05.851 --> 08:08.151
No, silly,
I take the bus.

08:08.186 --> 08:09.486
I'm in high school.

08:09.521 --> 08:10.521
What the hell?!

08:10.522 --> 08:11.655
You said you were 23!

08:11.690 --> 08:13.490
Yeah, and you said
you loved me.

08:13.525 --> 08:14.991
Well, I guess you
got me there.

08:17.562 --> 08:19.863
Hey, Quagmire,
sorry to bother you,

08:19.898 --> 08:21.865
but we're following up
on a tip.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.867
Did you have sex
with this underage girl?

08:23.902 --> 08:26.870
I don't want to go to jail, but
I really want to take credit.

08:26.905 --> 08:29.739
Quagmire, I'm afraid you're
under arrest for statutory rape.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.809
All right, but let me
just send the pictures

08:32.844 --> 08:34.878
I took of her last night
to all my friends.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.316
Oh, yeah!

08:38.317 --> 08:39.317
Boom!

08:39.318 --> 08:40.318
You're disgusting.

08:40.319 --> 08:41.484
Take him away.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.520
We've got all the awesome
evidence we need.

08:52.055 --> 08:54.356
"Hello, my name is
Glenn Quagmire.

08:54.391 --> 08:56.691
"I am a neighbor of yours
on Spooner Street.

08:56.727 --> 08:59.461
I am here to inform you
that I am a sex offender."

08:59.496 --> 09:01.963
It seems as though you could
have had some of that memorized.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.965
Glenn, what the
hell's going on?

09:04.001 --> 09:05.634
It turns out
that girl I took home

09:05.669 --> 09:07.502
from Peter's party last night
is in high school.

09:07.538 --> 09:08.970
Oh, my God!

09:09.006 --> 09:11.473
Does this mean you're gonna move
to Europe to make movies?

09:11.508 --> 09:14.309
How in the world did you
not know she was underage?

09:14.344 --> 09:16.812
Well, in retrospect,
she did ask a lot of questions

09:16.847 --> 09:18.113
about<i> To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

09:18.148 --> 09:19.347
Should have sent
her my way.

09:19.383 --> 09:20.482
I love that book.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.951
Oh, Gregory Peck-- whew!

09:22.986 --> 09:25.287
Anyway, now I gotta
go in front of a judge.

09:25.322 --> 09:26.322
Really?

09:26.323 --> 09:27.455
Number one or number two?

09:27.491 --> 09:29.958
Our judicial system
is so broken.

09:29.993 --> 09:32.294
No, Peter-- Glenn
has to go to court.

09:32.329 --> 09:33.461
That's right.

09:33.497 --> 09:35.463
And there's not even a defense
for statutory rape.

09:35.499 --> 09:37.966
Once the girl proves her age,
that's it-- you're guilty.

09:38.001 --> 09:39.634
You know what
I tried today?

09:39.670 --> 09:40.670
A fig.

09:40.671 --> 09:41.991
I have a hearing
tomorrow morning.

09:42.005 --> 09:43.471
I may have
to go to jail.

09:43.507 --> 09:46.141
My only hope for leniency is
to bring in character witnesses

09:46.176 --> 09:48.810
and show the court I'm not
the monster they say I am.

09:48.846 --> 09:51.146
Well, Peter would be
happy to support you.

09:51.181 --> 09:52.314
Yeah, you betcha,
Quagmire.

09:52.349 --> 09:53.349
I'm very persuasive.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.649
That's why I was so good

09:54.685 --> 09:56.651
at selling low-cost
car insurance.

09:58.355 --> 10:00.322
White-trash rates
from an army guy.

10:00.357 --> 10:02.157
Here is a penguin,
don't know why.

10:02.192 --> 10:03.658
<i>The General Car Insurance.</i>

10:03.694 --> 10:06.094
<i>It'll worry whoever you hit.</i>

10:11.335 --> 10:14.302
I can't believe Quagmire
and that girl had sex.

10:14.338 --> 10:16.471
Which is hugging someone
really hard with your legs.

10:16.506 --> 10:17.806
Nope.

10:17.841 --> 10:19.641
Well, you'll tell me
if I get it, though, right?

10:19.676 --> 10:21.142
Yeah, I'll tell
you if you get it.

10:21.178 --> 10:22.310
Okay, I'm gonna
get it.

10:22.346 --> 10:23.986
Now, Mr. Griffin,
I understand you're here

10:24.014 --> 10:25.814
to speak
on Mr. Quagmire's behalf.

10:25.849 --> 10:27.148
That's right,
Your Honor.

10:27.184 --> 10:29.150
And as we know, according
to<i> Game of Thrones,</i>

10:29.186 --> 10:31.653
if the girl has had her
blood, she is good to go.

10:31.688 --> 10:33.021
Has the girl had her blood?

10:33.056 --> 10:34.189
Answer the question.

10:34.224 --> 10:36.324
Mr. Griffin, she was underage.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.928
Yes, however, Mr. Quagmire
was born on February 29th.

10:39.963 --> 10:42.030
Ergo, he's only 12.

10:42.065 --> 10:44.032
Ergo, the girl raped him.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.767
<i>Argo,</i> Ben Affleck.

10:50.140 --> 10:51.606
Mr. Griffin,
do you have any evidence

10:51.642 --> 10:54.409
that is not based
on film or television?

10:54.444 --> 10:56.211
I don't know.
Why don't you ask

10:56.246 --> 10:58.880
all these letters
to Santa Claus?

11:00.484 --> 11:02.684
Something's going on.

11:02.719 --> 11:04.252
We haven't gotten
mail in a week.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.054
I-- I haven't gotten
mail in a week.

11:06.089 --> 11:08.123
Nobody writes you.

11:10.327 --> 11:13.228
Officer Swanson, I'll remind you
that you are under oath.

11:13.263 --> 11:14.429
Now, please tell us

11:14.464 --> 11:16.898
what Mr. Quagmire said
he did with the girl.

11:16.934 --> 11:18.466
He, uh,

11:18.502 --> 11:21.870
said he gave her a Frosty Jim.

11:21.905 --> 11:23.638
And can you please
explain to the courtroom

11:23.674 --> 11:26.408
what a Frosty Jim is.

11:26.443 --> 11:27.876
Uh...

11:27.911 --> 11:29.444
Sir, you're under oath.

11:29.479 --> 11:31.546
Well, it's when you
urinate in a condom,

11:31.581 --> 11:34.382
and tie it off, freeze it,

11:34.418 --> 11:36.384
and then the woman, um,

11:36.420 --> 11:37.819
pretends it's a man.

11:37.854 --> 11:40.055
Thank you.
He's a good guy!

11:43.560 --> 11:46.761
Mr. Brown, can you please state
your occupation for the court?

11:46.797 --> 11:49.497
Aw, come on, man, you didn't
ask anyone else to do that!

11:49.533 --> 11:50.999
Why am I on trial?!

11:51.034 --> 11:53.568
He's the one that mushed
hisself on a child!

11:53.603 --> 11:55.337
When are we gonna see
this chick?

11:55.372 --> 11:57.138
Okay, enough! No more help!

11:57.174 --> 12:00.075
I'm taking this Bible.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.110
You want to know what kind
of person Glenn Quagmire is?

12:02.145 --> 12:03.645
You want to know
what made me the person I am?

12:03.680 --> 12:05.480
Then put me on the stand.

12:05.515 --> 12:07.916
Lois, can I play
Angry Birds on your phone?

12:07.951 --> 12:10.085
Okay, but only
with the sound off.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.920
Fine. I'll just do it
with my mouth.

12:11.955 --> 12:12.988
Pa-shooo!

12:18.628 --> 12:20.595
Please, go ahead,
Mr. Quagmire.

12:20.630 --> 12:23.231
Look, I know everyone's sitting
out there judging me today.

12:23.266 --> 12:25.233
But before you do, please know

12:25.268 --> 12:27.469
I had it pretty
rough growing up.

12:27.504 --> 12:30.605
My dad was a military man,
so he wasn't around much.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.407
And my mom, well,
let's just say,

12:32.442 --> 12:34.142
she was a little promiscuous.

12:34.177 --> 12:37.479
In fact, I think my problems
started the day I was born.

12:37.514 --> 12:39.347
Wah! Wah! Wah!

12:39.383 --> 12:42.050
It's a boy,
Mrs. Quagmire.

12:42.085 --> 12:43.318
Oh, that's wonderful!

12:43.353 --> 12:44.386
How do you feel?

12:44.421 --> 12:46.421
Horny. Really horny.

12:46.456 --> 12:49.424
Could you put him back
so I can push him out again?

12:49.459 --> 12:52.027
I was born nine times that day.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.695
And things never got easier.

12:53.730 --> 12:55.797
The only way I learned
my ABC's was by learning

12:55.832 --> 12:58.700
the names of all the guys
my mom slept with.

12:58.735 --> 13:01.336
♪ Art, Bob, Chet,
Don, Ed, Frank, Gus ♪

13:01.371 --> 13:04.939

some of the guys ♪

13:15.218 --> 13:19.120
♪ There are lots
of other guys. ♪

13:19.156 --> 13:20.321
It was awful.

13:20.357 --> 13:22.157
I didn't even get to go
to my high school prom.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.792
But my mom did.

13:24.828 --> 13:27.228
Hey, is Crystal ready?

13:27.264 --> 13:28.630
Oh, hi, Ronnie.

13:28.665 --> 13:30.698
Hey, listen, have my mom
home by midnight, okay?

13:30.734 --> 13:33.401
How about I plow her in the limo
and have her home in 20 minutes?

13:33.437 --> 13:36.671
Ah, come on, Ronnie,
she bought the dress.

13:36.706 --> 13:38.840
So, you see, Your Honor,
thanks to my mom,

13:38.875 --> 13:41.576
I never had a chance to
be like everyone else.

13:41.611 --> 13:43.745
My misguided carnal instincts
are the result

13:43.780 --> 13:46.014
of being raised
by a sexual deviant.

13:46.049 --> 13:47.782
All I'm asking is
that you give me

13:47.818 --> 13:50.585
the break that
my childhood never did.

13:53.657 --> 13:56.391
Dairy Queen closes
in ten minutes.

13:58.628 --> 14:01.029
Mr. Quagmire,
your story is a sad one,

14:01.064 --> 14:03.431
but that doesn't
excuse your actions.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.901
I have no choice but to sentence
you to 20 years in prison.

14:08.905 --> 14:10.905
Oh, no you don't!

14:12.642 --> 14:13.642
Mom?!

14:13.677 --> 14:14.943
Crystal?

14:14.978 --> 14:18.279
Ha! She's enjoyed many men.

14:24.309 --> 14:26.042
Mom, what are you doing here?

14:26.078 --> 14:27.978
Do you know I'm carrying
three handguns,

14:28.013 --> 14:30.514
and the metal detectors
picked up nothing?

14:30.549 --> 14:32.382
Your Honor,
as the defendant's mother,

14:32.418 --> 14:35.118
I ask that you show
mercy on him.

14:35.154 --> 14:37.854
Well, as the victim's mother,
I ask that you go to hell!

14:37.890 --> 14:38.989
Where is
your daughter?

14:39.024 --> 14:40.557
Show her to us!

14:40.592 --> 14:42.993
Your Honor,
I have renounced my sinful past,

14:43.028 --> 14:44.861
and have been washed
in the blood

14:44.897 --> 14:47.164
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

14:47.199 --> 14:48.199
You what?!

14:48.233 --> 14:49.399
I have seen
the righteous path

14:49.435 --> 14:50.834
of our Savior,
and ask that you

14:50.869 --> 14:52.469
not sentence my son to jail,

14:52.504 --> 14:55.238
but instead release him
to my custody so that I,

14:55.274 --> 14:58.708
with God's guidance,
can rehabilitate him.

14:58.744 --> 15:01.144
Wow, Quagmire's mom is
a Jesus freak.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.813
I haven't been
this surprised since we went

15:02.848 --> 15:04.815
to that restaurant
on my birthday.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.451
All right, guys, let's pay
the check and get out of here.

15:09.955 --> 15:11.321

15:24.470 --> 15:26.770
Mom, I think something's
wrong with Dad.

15:26.805 --> 15:29.473
Peter? Peter?!

15:29.508 --> 15:31.308
Oh, my God! Help!

15:31.343 --> 15:33.076
Someone call 911!

15:33.111 --> 15:34.244
It's okay, ma'am.

15:34.279 --> 15:36.680
This happens here at
Bennigan's all the time.

15:40.118 --> 15:41.718
How long does this last?

15:41.753 --> 15:42.919
Hard to say.

15:42.955 --> 15:44.955
It's best to just move on.

15:52.731 --> 15:55.265
I'm sorry, Mrs. Quagmire,
but my sentence stands.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.867
20 years.

15:56.902 --> 15:58.768
Mr. Quagmire,
I'll give you 24 hours

15:58.804 --> 16:00.136
to get your affairs in order.

16:00.172 --> 16:02.072
Oh, my God.

16:02.107 --> 16:03.507
Ah, don't think
of it as 20 years.

16:03.542 --> 16:04.941
Think of it
as two ten-year-olds,

16:04.977 --> 16:06.743
you sick freak.

16:10.115 --> 16:12.916
God, 20 years.

16:12.951 --> 16:14.784
I know this is
a hard time for you,

16:14.820 --> 16:16.586
but you need
to seek forgiveness.

16:16.622 --> 16:18.622
You need to kneel before Jesus.

16:18.657 --> 16:20.457
Oh, he's gonna be kneeling
in front of a lot of guys,

16:20.492 --> 16:22.092
but I doubt
he'll catch their names.

16:22.127 --> 16:24.528
It's usually somebody pushing
your skull in the dark.

16:24.563 --> 16:26.229
There are really
no introductions.

16:26.265 --> 16:29.900
Remember, He is
inside you all the time.

16:29.935 --> 16:31.735
Oh, n-now she's
just setting me up.

16:31.770 --> 16:32.936
Right?

16:32.971 --> 16:34.404
How dare you come in here

16:34.439 --> 16:35.739
and tell me to seek forgiveness!

16:35.774 --> 16:37.107
Where do you get off?!

16:37.142 --> 16:38.408
Pretty much
everywhere, I hear.

16:38.443 --> 16:40.610
Fat man's right--
they're making this easy.

16:40.646 --> 16:43.213
You've never apologized once
for the way you raised me!

16:43.248 --> 16:45.248
You're the one who
made me what I am!

16:45.284 --> 16:47.017
Oh, come on, Quagmire,
you're a grown man,

16:47.052 --> 16:48.752
responsible for his own choices.

16:48.787 --> 16:51.488
Seems kind of cowardly to blame
someone else for your problems.

16:51.523 --> 16:53.823
Brian abandoned
his own son, by the way.

16:53.859 --> 16:55.926
Why are you, of all people,
defending a religious nut?

16:55.961 --> 16:57.460
Aren't you an atheist?

16:57.496 --> 16:58.695
Yeah, it's crazy.

16:58.730 --> 17:00.697
You can think about that
while you're in jail.

17:00.732 --> 17:02.098
Glenn, we're not
going to get anywhere

17:02.100 --> 17:03.767
questioning God's wisdom.

17:03.802 --> 17:06.102
He has a plan for everything.

17:06.138 --> 17:07.671
Oh, now I get it.

17:07.706 --> 17:09.205
That's why you found God.

17:09.241 --> 17:11.575
So you can absolve yourself
of any responsibility

17:11.610 --> 17:13.443
and answer everything
with empty platitudes.

17:13.478 --> 17:14.911
Face it, you're a worse parent

17:14.947 --> 17:17.247
than Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie.

17:17.282 --> 17:19.449
I'm concerned about Pax,
Maddox, and Shiloh.

17:19.484 --> 17:21.585
They're having
trouble adapting.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.587
They've been raised
with 11 languages,

17:23.622 --> 17:25.422
and really don't speak any.

17:25.457 --> 17:26.923
I hear you, Doctor.

17:26.959 --> 17:29.859
So... you're saying we should
give them all faux-hawks?

17:29.895 --> 17:32.228
No. I think they need
intensive therapy.

17:32.264 --> 17:34.164
Let me see if I understand you.

17:34.199 --> 17:36.533
Even shorter on the sides?

17:36.568 --> 17:37.767
Don't you see?

17:37.803 --> 17:40.337
This is your chance to open
your heart and let God in.

17:40.372 --> 17:42.472
I know this jail sentence
seems long.

17:42.507 --> 17:45.542
But salvation can
last all eternity.

17:45.577 --> 17:47.143
You know what else
lasts an eternity?

17:47.179 --> 17:49.212
This conversation.

17:49.247 --> 17:51.615
And maybe through our shared
relationship with the Lord,

17:51.650 --> 17:55.485
we can begin to build
a bond as mother and son.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.720
"Mother and son"?!

17:56.755 --> 17:58.555
Mothers love their children!

17:58.590 --> 18:00.223
They nurture them
and protect them!

18:00.258 --> 18:01.858
You've never done
a thing for me!

18:01.893 --> 18:03.360
I'd rather rot in
jail than sit here

18:03.395 --> 18:05.061
and listen to all your crap!

18:06.531 --> 18:08.131
Glenn's right.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.599
I was never there for him.

18:09.635 --> 18:11.868
I've got to find
some way to fix this.

18:11.903 --> 18:13.803
Did you hear about
your ex-husband yet?

18:13.839 --> 18:16.940
He had a... uh, procedure.

18:23.982 --> 18:26.549
You know, some families take
their baby to the zoo.

18:26.585 --> 18:29.119
That's also a fun activity.

18:29.154 --> 18:30.954
I'm really gonna
miss all you guys.

18:30.989 --> 18:33.690
And I'll think of you whenever
I choke on a link sausage.

18:33.725 --> 18:34.791
Take care, buddy.

18:35.894 --> 18:37.994
Oh, yeah!

18:38.030 --> 18:40.296
Fresh air! Freedom!

18:40.332 --> 18:41.998
Peter, while I'm away,

18:42.034 --> 18:45.035
I want you to hold onto my
antique, gold Rolex watch.

18:45.070 --> 18:46.970
Oh cool, a throwing watch!

18:47.005 --> 18:48.005
No, no, Peter, it--

18:48.040 --> 18:49.439
and I cannot stress
this enough--

18:49.474 --> 18:51.374
it is not a throwing watch.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.410
Oh, I hear you, Quagmire.

18:55.013 --> 18:57.313
It didn't come back,
like you said it would.

18:58.417 --> 18:59.916
And-and Joe, you
sure you don't mind

18:59.951 --> 19:01.217
taking care of my cat?

19:01.253 --> 19:02.819
Oh, no, all taken care of.

19:02.854 --> 19:04.287
Brought her
to the pound this morning.

19:04.322 --> 19:05.355
She went peacefully.

19:05.390 --> 19:06.690
What?! No!

19:06.725 --> 19:09.125
I-I-I meant, take care of
her, like, look after her!

19:09.161 --> 19:11.561
Well, that seems like
a note for this morning.

19:11.596 --> 19:14.097
You know, maybe I won't miss
you people as much as I thought.

19:14.132 --> 19:15.965
Do you have anything
for me, Glenn?

19:16.001 --> 19:17.767
What? No! Wha-what?!

19:17.803 --> 19:19.502
I just found out my cat died!

19:19.538 --> 19:22.072
Hmm. I can't help but think
this selfish attitude

19:22.107 --> 19:24.574
is part of what got you here.

19:24.609 --> 19:26.342
Good-bye, Glenn. Be strong.

19:26.378 --> 19:29.512
We'll keep you in our thoughts.

19:29.548 --> 19:31.481
Oh, y-you better get rid of that

19:31.516 --> 19:33.116
before you get in there.

19:33.151 --> 19:34.384
All right.

19:34.419 --> 19:35.452
Good-bye, everybody.

19:35.487 --> 19:37.287
And-and don't worry about me.

19:37.322 --> 19:38.588
I-I'll see you real soon.

19:41.893 --> 19:43.626
Hey, you guys take good care

19:43.662 --> 19:45.762
of my child rapist friend!

19:49.134 --> 19:50.834
Mr. Quagmire, wait!

19:50.869 --> 19:52.168
Judge?!

19:52.204 --> 19:53.470
What are you doing here?

19:53.505 --> 19:55.265
I wanted to tell you
the good news in person.

19:55.273 --> 19:57.107
Your sentence
has been commuted.

19:57.142 --> 19:59.876
You will not be serving
prison time after all.

19:59.911 --> 20:01.344
You got a good body, man.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.979
Why do you hide it
under that robe?

20:03.014 --> 20:04.380
"Commuted"?

20:04.416 --> 20:05.648
I don't understand.

20:05.684 --> 20:07.784
Hello, Glenn.

20:07.819 --> 20:08.952
Mom?!

20:08.987 --> 20:10.386
What's going on here?

20:10.422 --> 20:12.355
By the way, Your Honor,
your fly is down.

20:12.390 --> 20:16.126
Well, let's just say some
new DNA evidence was produced.

20:16.161 --> 20:17.827
And an impressive amount,
I'd say.

20:17.863 --> 20:20.096
Guy takes care of himself.

20:20.132 --> 20:21.531
Anyway, you're free to go.

20:21.566 --> 20:23.700
You... you're kidding!

20:23.735 --> 20:25.535
Mom... Di-did you...?

20:25.570 --> 20:26.903
Yep. Twice.

20:26.938 --> 20:28.671
But I-I thought you
were Christian now.

20:28.707 --> 20:32.509
Helping my son is the most
Christian thing I could do.

20:32.544 --> 20:34.911
You were right, Glenn.
I was a terrible mother.

20:34.946 --> 20:36.944
I wasn't there for you
when I should've been.

20:37.303 --> 20:40.204
But I'd love a second chance.

20:41.212 --> 20:42.574
I'd like that.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.991
I'd like that very much.

20:43.992 --> 20:48.692
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

20:48.770 --> 20:52.414
Aw, Quagmire got away with it,
and learned nothing.

20:52.415 --> 20:54.549
That's great.
