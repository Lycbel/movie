00:30.348 --> 00:35.848
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elder_man

00:35.849 --> 00:37.543
And that is why chest hair

00:37.585 --> 00:41.450
is on its way... back.

00:41.492 --> 00:42.722
Hey, guys.
I got something for you,

00:42.756 --> 00:45.123
an invitation for each
of you to Quagfest.

00:45.157 --> 00:47.325
Quagfest?
What's that?

00:47.367 --> 00:48.998
"You and a guest
are cordially invited

00:49.032 --> 00:52.201
"to witness Glenn Quagmire's
1,000th sexual conquest

00:52.242 --> 00:55.272
"at Quagfest,
a three-day festival celebrating

00:55.306 --> 00:57.440
the three F's:
food, fun, and..."

00:57.474 --> 00:59.439
Oh, my.

00:59.481 --> 01:01.647
Yeah, they almost wouldn't print
that at Kinko's.

01:01.681 --> 01:03.310
Damn! 1,000 women?

01:03.344 --> 01:05.582
Well, 1,000
sexual conquests.

01:05.616 --> 01:07.581
No further questions.

01:07.615 --> 01:09.254
Sounds like fun, Glenn!

01:09.287 --> 01:10.751
Yeah, I'm closing down
the whole street.

01:10.793 --> 01:12.088
It's gonna be
like a block party

01:12.122 --> 01:14.927
but with way more weirdos
grinding up against your wives.

01:14.961 --> 01:16.358
That sounds awesome!

01:16.392 --> 01:18.437
There hasn't been that kind
of excitement on our street

01:18.471 --> 01:21.013
since we had that big Dumpster
in our front yard.

01:21.047 --> 01:23.290
Can someone take out
the garbage?

01:23.324 --> 01:24.954
I will!

01:27.724 --> 01:29.691
Yeah!

01:29.725 --> 01:32.027
Yeah! Smash! Boom!

01:32.061 --> 01:33.365
Someone stop him.

01:33.399 --> 01:36.038
Last time, he threw out
our whole bedroom.

01:36.072 --> 01:38.376
I'm still in here!

01:38.410 --> 01:39.913
Oh, big Dumpster--
that-that reminds me,

01:39.947 --> 01:42.515
Ice-T's wife is also coming
to Quagfest.

01:42.549 --> 01:43.980
And in local news,

01:44.022 --> 01:46.117
Hollywood comes to Quahog,
almost,

01:46.159 --> 01:48.526
as three hours from here
in Waterbury, Connecticut,

01:48.560 --> 01:51.528
Liam Neeson has begun shooting
his latest film.

01:51.562 --> 01:54.464
His new project is reportedly
an historical epic,

01:54.498 --> 01:56.064
in which Mr. Neeson stars

01:56.098 --> 01:58.601
as a vengeance-crazed
Albert Einstein.

01:58.635 --> 02:01.076
Channel Five News
has this exclusive first look

02:01.110 --> 02:04.249
that I taped off my VCR
from<i> Entertainment Tonight.</i>

02:04.283 --> 02:06.587
All right,
I'll give you the formula.

02:06.621 --> 02:10.261
My foot equals
your balls squared.

02:12.231 --> 02:14.398
Pfft. Liam Neeson. What a fraud.

02:14.432 --> 02:16.536
Oh, come on, Peter.
Not this again.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.578
What? He's a fake tough guy.
I could totally kick his ass.

02:19.612 --> 02:20.842
Knock it off.
We've had to hear

02:20.876 --> 02:22.579
this same speech
a million times.

02:22.613 --> 02:24.714
Yeah, every time you get
a couple of beers in you,

02:24.748 --> 02:27.314
we have to hear all about
how you can beat up Liam Neeson.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.187
That's not true.
Yes, it is.

02:29.221 --> 02:32.492
What about that time we
snuck beers into the opera?

02:59.191 --> 03:01.997
I could
totally beat up Liam Neeson.

03:12.682 --> 03:14.480
Hey, you know this old woman
who lived in a shoe,

03:14.514 --> 03:16.744
she had so many children,
she didn't know what to do?

03:16.786 --> 03:18.080
I got something
she could do.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.752
Get your tubes tied,
you kook!

03:19.787 --> 03:21.585
Hey, how you doing
on that chocolate milk?

03:21.619 --> 03:22.921
You need
a little freshen-up?

03:22.955 --> 03:25.193
There's
my little sweetie.

03:25.227 --> 03:26.690
Are you ready
to go home, Stewie?

03:26.724 --> 03:28.501
Oh, Lois,
I'm glad you're here.

03:28.535 --> 03:30.903
I noticed that you're one
of the moms who hasn't yet

03:30.937 --> 03:32.569
signed up to be
a classroom volunteer.

03:32.610 --> 03:35.580
Oh, I-I just assumed after
that incident in the parking lot

03:35.614 --> 03:38.118
with that bitch in the Lexus,
you wouldn't want me to.

03:38.152 --> 03:41.424
But, yeah, I'd be happy
to help out in the class.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.689
What? I don't want you here.
This is my turf.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.026
I don't bother you when you're
sitting on the washing machine,

03:46.060 --> 03:48.194
screaming Aaron Eckhart's name.

03:48.236 --> 03:50.868
Great! We'd love to have you
start tomorrow, if you're free.

03:50.902 --> 03:53.404
Sure, let me just
check my schedule.

03:53.438 --> 03:57.609
Hmm, I guess I could
just get the mail at night.

04:03.485 --> 04:06.989
Wow, Quagfest is a bigger deal
than I thought.

04:07.023 --> 04:08.790
Oh, look, here's a simulation

04:08.824 --> 04:11.893
of what it's like to have sex
with Quagmire.

04:15.326 --> 04:16.892
Hi.

04:21.669 --> 04:22.669
Bye!

04:28.511 --> 04:30.478
All right, kids,
now pay attention, all right?

04:30.512 --> 04:33.615
These are all of Quagmire's
women organized by country.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.647
There's Brazil.

04:36.649 --> 04:38.424
There's Italy.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.424
And there's Thailand. Wow.

04:40.458 --> 04:44.056
Wow, they're young.
We should go.

04:44.098 --> 04:46.727
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to Quagfest.

04:46.761 --> 04:49.262
Now, no celebration
of my 1,000th would be complete

04:49.296 --> 04:50.933
without first meeting
number one.

04:50.968 --> 04:54.069
Here she is, all the way from
Weathersfield Elementary School,

04:54.103 --> 04:56.101
Miss Eleanor!

05:02.849 --> 05:05.144
Do I still get
a piece of candy after?

05:08.122 --> 05:09.751
Nice lady.

05:09.785 --> 05:11.422
All right, we've met number one.

05:11.457 --> 05:14.087
Now let's meet number 1,000!

05:22.058 --> 05:26.023
Ladies and gentlemen,
my 1,000th sexual conquest is...

05:26.065 --> 05:28.063
this largemouth bass!

05:29.065 --> 05:30.695
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

05:30.737 --> 05:32.502
I'm weird.

05:32.536 --> 05:34.502
I thought I was here
to watch normal intercourse

05:34.536 --> 05:36.165
on a residential street.

05:36.207 --> 05:38.373
Children, we're leaving!

05:44.646 --> 05:45.876
Oh, this'll be so fun

05:45.910 --> 05:47.876
volunteering in
your class, Stewie.

05:47.918 --> 05:49.547
Eat my button,
you whore.

05:49.581 --> 05:51.548
Oh, Lois, I'm so
glad you're here.

05:51.582 --> 05:53.420
I got to run out
to the parking lot.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.420
I'm buying cigarettes
from some guy on Craigslist.

05:55.454 --> 05:57.819
Go ahead.
I'll handle the kids.

05:59.858 --> 06:02.153
Oh, Landon,
what's the matter?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.191
Aw, did you spill juice
on yourself, sweetheart?

06:05.225 --> 06:07.527
"Sweetheart"? Slow your roll
there,<i> Cougar Town.</i>

06:07.561 --> 06:10.262
Well, let's get you cleaned up.
And you know what?

06:10.296 --> 06:12.998
For today,
you can be my little helper.

06:13.032 --> 06:15.870
What the hell?! If anyone should
be her helper, it should be me.

06:15.904 --> 06:18.071
She's my mother.
We're supposed to be a team.

06:18.105 --> 06:20.639
Like the Lone Ranger and Tonto.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.776
Well, Tonto, the bad guys
are going to jail.

06:22.810 --> 06:25.049
Looks like this little town
is safe again.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.650
Yes, Kemosabe.

06:26.684 --> 06:27.915
So, uh, what do you say?

06:27.956 --> 06:29.921
Want to grab a drink,
maybe dinner?

06:29.956 --> 06:32.954
Sorry. Me no like to
hang with work people.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.130
Well, I got to hand
it to you, Quagmire.

06:41.163 --> 06:43.130
That Quagfest
was some party.

06:43.171 --> 06:45.864
Yeah, except I got molested
in the House of Mirrors

06:45.906 --> 06:48.870
by either one man
or 100 identical men.

06:48.904 --> 06:51.270
Could've used a
heads-up on that one.

06:51.304 --> 06:54.270
Yeah, I'll tell you who might
want a heads-up: Liam Neeson.

06:54.312 --> 06:55.877
Oh, for God's sake!

06:55.911 --> 06:58.277
'Cause someday,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

06:58.311 --> 06:59.446
Damn it, Peter,
I'm sick of this!

06:59.480 --> 07:01.182
I've had it!
Me, too.

07:01.216 --> 07:03.350
I mean, we just had a
great day of fun and rides

07:03.384 --> 07:04.981
and finger-sniffing,
and all you can talk about

07:05.016 --> 07:06.717
is fighting some guy
you've never even met!

07:06.751 --> 07:08.588
Yeah, he's lucky
we've never met.

07:08.622 --> 07:10.524
I'd knock his teeth
down his throat

07:10.558 --> 07:12.523
and out his stupid
Irish fudge knot.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.187
You know what?
You're full of it.

07:14.229 --> 07:15.996
If you were ever face-to-face
with Liam Neeson,

07:16.030 --> 07:17.060
you'd crap your pants.

07:17.094 --> 07:18.195
No, I wouldn't.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.531
Well, fine.
Let's prove it.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.468
Put up or shut up.
Right now.

07:21.502 --> 07:23.268
What? What are
you talking about?

07:23.302 --> 07:25.465
Well, we know where
Liam Neeson is.

07:25.499 --> 07:28.071
That's right! He's shooting
a movie in Connecticut!

07:28.105 --> 07:30.269
We could be there
in three hours.

07:30.303 --> 07:31.604
All right, great.

07:31.638 --> 07:34.098
Liam Neeson has three more hours
to live.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.433
Let's do this.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.504
All right!
Yeah!

07:36.538 --> 07:38.967
I've never been
to Connecticut!

07:39.009 --> 07:40.376
Hang on, fellas.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.975
I actually have been
to Connecticut one time.

07:43.009 --> 07:45.446
To meet Loretta
at a McDonald's parking lot

07:45.480 --> 07:47.774
to pick up my son,
Cleveland, Jr.

07:47.816 --> 07:50.646
I cried in my sedan,
in front of my boy.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.782
It was sad.
That's why I fibbed on it.

07:53.816 --> 07:55.990
I'm sorry.
Can we do a happy yell again

07:56.024 --> 07:58.190
to get the taste out
of my mouth? All right!

07:58.225 --> 08:00.254
Yeah! Yeah!
I've been to Connecticut!

08:07.262 --> 08:08.564
All right, Peter,
Liam Neeson must be

08:08.598 --> 08:10.037
on the other side
of that barrier.

08:10.071 --> 08:12.940
We just got to get you on that
set, so you can kick his ass.

08:12.974 --> 08:16.371
We're so close, I can
almost taste his ass.

08:16.405 --> 08:17.970
Can I help you?

08:18.004 --> 08:19.978
Hello, sir.
We're here to see Liam Neeson,

08:20.012 --> 08:22.642
the guy who wears the same
long jacket in all his movies.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.778
Sorry, this is
a closed set.

08:24.812 --> 08:27.179
Peter, you're never gonna
get close enough to Liam Neeson

08:27.221 --> 08:28.787
to throw a punch
at the guy.

08:28.821 --> 08:31.323
That's why I got to lure
him out here to come to me.

08:31.357 --> 08:33.259
Remember, Liam
Neeson's Irish.

08:33.293 --> 08:35.595
That's why I'm dressing
up as the one woman

08:35.629 --> 08:39.828
no Irishman can resist:
Mrs. Potato Head.

08:39.862 --> 08:42.163
Ooh, Mrs. Potato Head here!

08:42.197 --> 08:45.772
Any Irish actors around
who might be interested in me?

08:45.806 --> 08:47.437
You're damn right, darlin'.

08:47.471 --> 08:49.572
Colin Farrell?
What are you doing here?

08:49.606 --> 08:51.043
Shoo! Shoo! Get away!

08:51.077 --> 08:53.948
Oh-ho, you're
a feisty potato.

08:56.182 --> 08:59.182
The back is all
mashed potatoes now.

09:01.058 --> 09:03.563
Okay, guys, there's no better
way to draw out an Irishman

09:03.597 --> 09:06.029
than setting up
a confession booth.

09:11.244 --> 09:13.244
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

09:13.246 --> 09:15.885
It has been one day
since my last confession.

09:15.919 --> 09:17.222
Go on, my son.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.888
I killed
200 wolves.

09:18.921 --> 09:21.024
After the movie,
I got the taste for it.

09:21.058 --> 09:22.425
Did you kill them quickly?

09:22.459 --> 09:24.362
No. Wolves
must be tortured.

09:24.396 --> 09:26.836
The best way to kill wolves
is to kill their leader,

09:26.870 --> 09:30.771
wear his skin, kiss some of
the wolves, then kill them.

09:30.805 --> 09:33.372
I also steal small
items from 7-Eleven.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.444
SweeTarts, Jolly
Ranchers, and the like.

09:35.478 --> 09:36.981
Sometimes
a lighter.

09:37.015 --> 09:38.581
I don't
even smoke.

09:38.615 --> 09:40.918
Sometimes I roll up
those tattoo magazines,

09:40.952 --> 09:42.519
stuff 'em
up my sleeve.

09:42.553 --> 09:45.191
If I get caught, I just
tell the man I forgot.

09:45.225 --> 09:47.863
Then, of course, it's
back to murdering wolves.

09:47.897 --> 09:50.328
All right.
Uh, that'll be, uh...

09:50.362 --> 09:52.064
three Hail Marys.

09:52.098 --> 09:53.536
Tough but fair.

09:53.570 --> 09:55.873
Thank you, Father.

09:56.907 --> 09:58.273
Uh, hey, not so fast!

09:58.307 --> 10:00.775
Excuse me, sir. We were sent
here by the production.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.839
Are you the guy who's been
looking for Liam Neeson?

10:02.873 --> 10:05.247
I am.
Do you mind if we ask what for?

10:05.281 --> 10:07.376
Yeah, I was hopin'
to inflict violence upon him.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.511
All right,
you're coming with us.

10:09.553 --> 10:10.847
Don't worry, Peter!

10:10.881 --> 10:13.718
We'll raise your bail money
as soon as we can!

10:14.753 --> 10:16.391
Uh, excuse me, sir.

10:16.425 --> 10:17.855
My phone's not working.

10:17.889 --> 10:21.191
Do you mind if I follow
you home and use yours?

10:24.433 --> 10:26.737
All right, kids,

10:26.771 --> 10:28.740
Miss Tammy's in her car
yelling at her boyfriend

10:28.774 --> 10:32.541
on the phone again, so it
looks like I'm doing lunch.

10:35.450 --> 10:37.418
Okay, Landon,
time to sabotage you

10:37.452 --> 10:40.490
with the most dangerous thing
in the world for a toddler:

10:40.524 --> 10:42.923
a whole, uncut grape.

10:45.302 --> 10:47.435
God, look how fat
kids are getting.

10:47.469 --> 10:49.299
Oh, Landon, no!

10:49.333 --> 10:51.203
Uh-uh, you could
choke on that!

10:51.237 --> 10:53.770
Did your mommy forget to
slice your grapes for you?

10:53.804 --> 10:55.443
Here, let me help.

10:55.477 --> 10:57.643
Ugh, there's nothing
to cut these with.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.086
Oh, that's it, Landon!

11:03.120 --> 11:04.822
If you're gonna
seduce my mother,

11:04.856 --> 11:06.887
then I shall seduce yours.

11:06.921 --> 11:10.424
I'll be as irresistible to her
as wood is to a woodchuck.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.193
Mom, Dad, I've done
a lot of thinking,

11:13.235 --> 11:16.101
and I've decided I don't want
to go into the family business.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.910
I want to be
a doctor.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.247
Hmm. Let's try that on
for size.

11:20.281 --> 11:23.880
How much disease could
a woodchuck doctor cure

11:23.914 --> 11:26.783
if a woodchuck doctor
could cure disease?

11:26.817 --> 11:28.614
Is that sounding right to you?

11:28.656 --> 11:30.421
No.

11:30.455 --> 11:32.253
Hey, Jimmy?
Yeah, Dad?

11:32.287 --> 11:34.188
Next time, if you have an idea,

11:34.222 --> 11:37.555
run it through the test
before you embarrass yourself.

11:43.998 --> 11:45.196
Wake up, Griffin.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.533
Your bail's been posted.

11:47.575 --> 11:49.372
What time is it?

11:51.638 --> 11:53.740
<i>I</i> did.

11:53.774 --> 11:56.812
Oh, sorry. I thought you were
gonna ask something else.

11:56.846 --> 11:59.646
Liam Neeson?!
<i>You</i> posted my bail?!

11:59.687 --> 12:01.950
That's right. I hear
you've been all over town

12:01.984 --> 12:04.189
saying you could kick my arse.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.756
Well, there's no time
like the present.

12:10.726 --> 12:14.595
Go ahead, take...
your best... shot.

12:14.629 --> 12:16.163
Oh, no, no, no,
Mr. Neeson,

12:16.197 --> 12:17.427
you heard wrong.

12:17.469 --> 12:19.803
There's nobody who
respects you more than I do.

12:19.837 --> 12:22.602
May I offer you the most
sincere, honest apology I...?

12:22.636 --> 12:24.035
Ha, ha!

12:24.069 --> 12:25.675
Ow! Ah, damn it!

12:25.709 --> 12:28.275
My hands are stinging
from the vibrations!

12:28.309 --> 12:29.675
My turn.

12:29.709 --> 12:30.907
Aah!

12:30.949 --> 12:32.979
<i>Will Liam Neeson punch Peter?</i>

12:33.013 --> 12:35.650
<i>Will Stewie stop being jealous</i>
<i>of his mom or something?</i>

12:35.685 --> 12:38.417
<i>Stay tuned for the thrilling</i>
<i>conclusion of this story,</i>

12:38.452 --> 12:41.289
<i>and the just-regular conclusion</i>
<i>of the other story.</i>

12:46.863 --> 12:48.564
Oh, please don't hurt me!

12:48.598 --> 12:51.500
I was just trying to seem
tough in front of my friends!

12:51.535 --> 12:53.229
Well, you're in trouble
now, lad.

12:53.271 --> 12:56.300
I've been a world-famous
tough guy since I was 55.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.614
Please, please,
I'll do anything!

12:57.637 --> 12:59.570
Anything you want,
just don't kill me!

12:59.604 --> 13:01.305
What could you possibly
do for me?

13:01.339 --> 13:02.966
I'll-I'll-I'll
shine your shoes,

13:03.008 --> 13:04.301
or scrub your toilets!

13:04.335 --> 13:05.668
Or coil your penis!

13:05.702 --> 13:06.836
The Internet tells
me that's something

13:06.870 --> 13:08.476
you might have
a need for.

13:08.510 --> 13:11.845
Hmm... well, that could save me
some time in the morning.

13:11.879 --> 13:14.508
Whatever it takes for
you to not beat me up.

13:14.550 --> 13:15.843
All right, it's a deal.

13:15.877 --> 13:17.683
You can help me
with some chores.

13:17.717 --> 13:20.219
But one slip-up,
and you'll be deader

13:20.253 --> 13:23.355
than the first man to die
in the Battle of the Boyne.

13:33.735 --> 13:37.208
Normally when we do those,
there's-there's, like, a joke.

13:37.242 --> 13:39.675
I'm not your clown.

13:47.088 --> 13:49.494
All right, Landon,
let's see how<i> you</i> like it

13:49.528 --> 13:51.591
when someone moves in
on your territory.

13:51.632 --> 13:56.000
Let's just say your mom's about
to see a diaper rashy scrotum.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.507
Wow, I didn't know Landon
had a younger sister.

14:00.541 --> 14:03.243
Oh, hi. Aren't you a cutie.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.244
Oh my God,
this is gonna happen.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.452
Okay, go run along
with your teacher.

14:07.486 --> 14:09.020
Time for me to go.

14:09.054 --> 14:10.653
W-Wait, wait,
don't leave!

14:10.687 --> 14:11.885
Ow! My knee!

14:14.094 --> 14:16.461
Oh, sweetie,
did you get a boo-boo?

14:16.495 --> 14:18.494
Here, let me kiss it
and make it better.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.504
Okay, that's
more like it.

14:24.202 --> 14:28.672
Oh, I certainly hope no one sees
Landon's mom bobbing for Stew.

14:30.546 --> 14:32.679
Yeah, get in there.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.143
Damn it, she's
not watching.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.511
You keep going, though.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.950
Don't forget about the
underneath part of my knee.

14:41.985 --> 14:44.391
Okay, Peter, I've got
a list of chores here.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.559
Um, first, I've been summoned
to be a potential juror,

14:47.593 --> 14:49.223
but I don't want to go,

14:49.265 --> 14:51.358
so I need you to report
in my name.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.597
Prospective juror number 17,
the defendant is a kraken.

14:54.631 --> 14:57.367
Would you have any problem
convicting a kraken?

14:57.401 --> 15:00.736
Um, I would try to be fair,
but, uh, I am on record,

15:00.778 --> 15:03.439
you know, very famously,
as having released a kraken.

15:03.473 --> 15:06.646
Your Honor, we'd like to thank
and excuse juror number 17.

15:07.944 --> 15:09.310
Hey, man, thanks.

15:09.344 --> 15:10.919
Yeah, good luck, man.

15:13.017 --> 15:15.583
Okay, I have another
important job for you.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.623
I want you to take
over my Twitter feed

15:17.657 --> 15:19.927
and tweet back
to my fans.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.504
See? Like that.

15:29.538 --> 15:32.304
You get the gist of
what my Twitter is about.

15:34.305 --> 15:36.744
Peter, I was
at an outdoor mall today,

15:36.778 --> 15:39.882
and there was a kiosk selling
little remote control cars.

15:39.916 --> 15:41.882
One of them drove
right up to me.

15:43.316 --> 15:46.756
It was very funny and enjoyable,
so what I need you to do is

15:46.790 --> 15:50.028
to go to a local gym and ask men
to pee in your hands.

15:50.062 --> 15:52.763
I-I don't see the
connection there.

15:52.797 --> 15:54.698
Do I need
to repeat myself?

15:54.732 --> 15:56.562
The car came
right up to me.

15:56.595 --> 16:00.099
It... it did spins
and had flashing lights.

16:00.141 --> 16:01.837
I enjoyed it.

16:01.871 --> 16:04.245
Go to the gym,
kneel down in the shower,

16:04.279 --> 16:07.445
and ask strange men
to pee in your cupped hands.

16:10.585 --> 16:12.655
Hey, man, did Liam
Neeson send you?

16:14.321 --> 16:16.886
Yeah, he loves
them little cars.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.535
All right, guys, how are
we doing on Peter's bail money?

16:25.569 --> 16:27.431
I got my whole family
praying on it.

16:27.473 --> 16:28.671
Well, that's
very helpful.

16:28.705 --> 16:30.103
How about you, Joe?

16:30.138 --> 16:32.704
Oh, Bonnie won't let me
spend any more money on Peter

16:32.745 --> 16:34.712
because he's not
very nice to me.

16:34.746 --> 16:36.176
Hey, guys.
What the hell?!

16:36.210 --> 16:38.177
You're out of jail!
How'd you get out?

16:38.219 --> 16:40.311
With my smooth
talki... ta...

16:40.345 --> 16:42.517
My... I used...
I... My... word...

16:42.551 --> 16:44.582
My... I words...
I used words.

16:44.616 --> 16:46.055
Wow. Glad you're back.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.551
So, you ready to admit

16:47.593 --> 16:49.792
you're never gonna kick
Liam Neeson's ass?

16:49.826 --> 16:52.927
It just so happens,
Joe, that I already did.

16:52.961 --> 16:54.231
You<i> what?!</i>

16:54.265 --> 16:55.631
If you beat up
Liam Neeson,

16:55.665 --> 16:57.263
how come it wasn't
in the papers?

16:57.297 --> 16:58.903
Oh, you know, he's a big star.

16:58.937 --> 17:00.535
He had the whole thing
covered up.

17:00.569 --> 17:02.702
Everybody knows Irish Catholics
control the media.

17:08.313 --> 17:10.373
Oop, uh, oh, Chris
was shot at school.

17:10.407 --> 17:13.213
If it's not
one thing, it's another.

17:17.214 --> 17:19.050
You know what?
I-I've thought about it.

17:19.084 --> 17:20.482
Do what you want
with Landon.

17:20.516 --> 17:22.818
Just don't do it
in front of me, all right?

17:22.852 --> 17:24.187
Oh, hi, Landon.

17:24.221 --> 17:25.893
How are you today, cutie?

17:25.927 --> 17:28.127
Aah! What did I
just tell you?!

17:28.161 --> 17:29.894
I hate this! I hate you!

17:29.928 --> 17:31.165
I hate everything!

17:33.630 --> 17:35.532
Oh, Stewie, you're upset.

17:35.566 --> 17:37.866
Are... are you jealous?

17:37.900 --> 17:40.137
Yes! You've destroyed us!

17:40.171 --> 17:42.136
Were you at least safe?

17:42.170 --> 17:44.440
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

17:44.474 --> 17:46.671
You'll always be
my favorite little boy.

17:46.705 --> 17:49.406
I will?

17:53.142 --> 17:56.778
And besides, my week
as a helper mommy is done now,

17:56.812 --> 18:00.713
so when you come home today,
you'll have me all to yourself.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.552
Oh. Ok... Okay.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.215
Hey, you-you hear that,
Landon?

18:06.257 --> 18:09.150
That's how you keep
your bitch in line.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.060
So, you know, Jar Jar
wasn't there the whole time.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.828
It was just a
green screen.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.659
Yes, I heard you
say that earlier.

18:18.693 --> 18:19.962
Peter?

18:19.996 --> 18:22.866
Quagmire? Cleveland?!

18:22.900 --> 18:24.602
And me.
I'm here, too.

18:24.635 --> 18:26.233
You're wh...?
What are you doing here?

18:26.267 --> 18:28.337
Well, you were acting weird,
so we followed you.

18:28.371 --> 18:29.737
We want to know
what's going on.

18:29.771 --> 18:31.273
Well, h-how'd you
guys get on the set?

18:31.307 --> 18:33.273
I bit the security guard
in the nards.

18:33.307 --> 18:36.610
I don't like to do it a lot,
but you're my friend, Peter.

18:36.644 --> 18:37.977
Who are these
two idiots?

18:38.011 --> 18:38.913
Three.
Three idiots.

18:38.947 --> 18:39.913
Big fan.

18:39.947 --> 18:41.481
And what's up
with Liam Neeson?

18:41.515 --> 18:42.945
You said
you kicked his ass.

18:44.187 --> 18:45.187
Look, you guys, I...

18:45.188 --> 18:47.089
I lied about that.

18:47.123 --> 18:48.089
What?!

18:48.123 --> 18:49.825
I acted like such a big man,

18:49.859 --> 18:52.426
and I didn't want to admit
I was a coward.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.992
I was too scared
to fight Liam Neeson.

18:55.026 --> 18:57.160
That's why he's
my big fat houseboy now.

18:57.193 --> 18:59.128
Now, Peter,
I'm out of crackers,

18:59.169 --> 19:00.432
and I'm gluten-free,

19:00.466 --> 19:02.736
so what I need you to
do is go to a local gym

19:02.770 --> 19:04.272
and ask men to
pee in your hands.

19:04.306 --> 19:05.840
What the hell?!

19:05.906 --> 19:08.240
Come on, what are you
waiting for, Griffin?

19:08.274 --> 19:11.713
No, Liam, I'm not doing
your stupid chores anymore.

19:11.747 --> 19:13.713
And there's something else
I got to tell you.

19:13.747 --> 19:15.218
Your story thread
in<i> Love, Actually</i>

19:15.252 --> 19:17.218
is the second worst.

19:17.252 --> 19:18.818
You better take that back.

19:18.852 --> 19:22.658
No way your son would learn the
drums in that amount of time.

19:22.692 --> 19:24.226
Oh, that tears it!

19:32.667 --> 19:34.001
Aah!

20:04.360 --> 20:05.458
Hey, Peter, you're
up there, now?

20:05.459 --> 20:06.887
Who's winning?

20:06.929 --> 20:07.929
Aah!

20:29.992 --> 20:31.990
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:32.024 --> 20:34.622
I'm off to get a free
movie set haircut.

20:35.759 --> 20:37.228
Damn it!

20:37.262 --> 20:40.164
I was stupid to think I
could beat up Liam Neeson.

20:40.945 --> 20:42.910
You guys must
think I'm pathetic.

20:42.944 --> 20:45.412
Are you kidding?
You took on the star of<i> Kinsey!</i>

20:45.415 --> 20:46.916
Yeah, and more
importantly,

20:46.950 --> 20:49.552
you followed through
on your drunken ravings.

20:49.719 --> 20:51.848
Wow. I guess
you're right.

20:52.570 --> 20:54.319
Thanks, guys.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.918
You know, I guess
the lesson here is,

20:55.952 --> 20:57.253
Oskar Schindler
wasn't real.

20:57.287 --> 20:58.885
And neither was
anything in that movie.

20:58.927 --> 21:00.989
I-I-I don't think
that's the lesson.
