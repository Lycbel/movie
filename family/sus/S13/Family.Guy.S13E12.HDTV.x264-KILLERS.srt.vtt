Stewie Is Enceinte
Original Air Date on February 15, 2015

@elder_man

00:34.292 --> 00:37.460
Looney Tunes Edition.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.396
Okay, Chef Fudd, I was a little
disappointed in you this week.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.098
Your dish was
just a live rabbit

00:42.133 --> 00:43.799
who thought
he was taking a bath.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.635
But I used
carrots and celery.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.838
Yes. I saw he was scrubbing his
back with a long celery stalk.

00:48.873 --> 00:50.406
Chef Sylvester,
on the other hand,

00:50.441 --> 00:52.642
I'm happy to say
your sufferin' succotash

00:52.677 --> 00:54.310
was absolutely delicious.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.678
Thanks.

00:55.713 --> 00:57.680
Hello?

00:57.715 --> 00:58.948
Oh, hi, Bonnie.

00:58.983 --> 01:00.349
No, I'm not doing anything.

01:00.385 --> 01:02.018
Just sitting here
with the baby.

01:02.053 --> 01:03.352
Yeah, screw you, too.

01:03.388 --> 01:05.187
Oh, hey, Bri.
Hey, you want to go out

01:05.223 --> 01:06.522
and get some
gluten-free pizza?

01:06.558 --> 01:07.990
I'm gluten-free now.
But, you know,

01:08.026 --> 01:09.692
I'm not gonna be
annoying about it.

01:09.727 --> 01:10.393
Too late.

01:10.395 --> 01:11.873
Oh, we should be
gluten-free together!

01:11.896 --> 01:14.530
Let's go to Whole Foods
and buy a bunch of stuff

01:14.566 --> 01:16.499
from that weird aisle
nobody else goes down.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.701
I can't. I got plans.
I'll see you later.

01:18.736 --> 01:20.903
Oh, sure.
Maybe another time.

01:20.939 --> 01:23.372
Ugh. I didn't seem
too desperate, right?

01:23.408 --> 01:26.676
Don't answer. It's just that
Brian's been so distant lately,

01:26.711 --> 01:30.012
and we used to be inseparable--
like Jack and Jill.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.181
Oh, so then Jack takes
these two pails of water

01:32.216 --> 01:34.550
and trips and totally
falls down the hill.

01:34.586 --> 01:35.751
Ha, ha, ha.

01:35.787 --> 01:37.687
Yeah. Hey,
I got a funny story.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.855
Jill had a tooth fall out,
and she swallowed it,

01:39.891 --> 01:42.458
and then we had to root
through her feces to find it.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.827
And we did. And then
we took it to the dentist,

01:44.862 --> 01:46.562
and he put it back
in her mouth.

01:46.598 --> 01:48.097
So I guess
we're both klutzes, huh?

01:48.132 --> 01:50.166
Why don't you spin
another tale, crap-tooth?

01:50.201 --> 01:51.701
No? My turn again?

01:51.736 --> 01:54.370
Okay. Jill's barren.

02:00.044 --> 02:01.811
Good afternoon.
I'm Tom Tucker.

02:01.846 --> 02:05.047
Some sad news this morning
as 38 schoolchildren drowned

02:05.083 --> 02:07.383
when their--

02:07.418 --> 02:10.353
excuse me-- when their
school bus hit a patch of ice

02:10.388 --> 02:13.623
and drove off a loc--

02:13.658 --> 02:15.524
what is wrong with me today?--

02:15.560 --> 02:17.093
and drove off a local bridge.

02:17.128 --> 02:18.961
And now the viral video
of the week,

02:18.997 --> 02:20.396
with over seven million views.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.498
For those of you
who loved "Screaming Sheep,"

Is it some kind of bug?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.401
What? You serious?
So it<i> is</i> a bug?

02:58.436 --> 03:00.403
Hey, you know, that's
what we ought to do.

03:00.438 --> 03:01.837
We ought to make
a viral video.

03:01.873 --> 03:03.305
All right! Awesome!
Let's do it!

03:03.341 --> 03:05.708
Oh, wait, I don't know if
you're gonna be in it, Joe.

03:05.743 --> 03:06.976
I thought, while we filmed,

03:07.011 --> 03:09.345
we'd just keep all of
our stuff on your lap.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.783
What the hell
are you doing?

03:13.818 --> 03:16.819
I saw a scary boy doing this,
and I thought I'd try it.

03:16.854 --> 03:17.854
All right, have fun.

03:17.889 --> 03:18.889
I'm late.
Late?

03:18.923 --> 03:20.956
But I thought you and I
could hang out

03:20.992 --> 03:22.525
and maybe watch Lois
shush Peter

03:22.560 --> 03:23.993
while they watch<i> Nashville.</i>

03:24.028 --> 03:26.429
Maybe another
time, Stewie.

03:26.464 --> 03:27.630
There he goes<i> again.</i>

03:27.665 --> 03:29.065
He's being so standoffish.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.533
I don't understand.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.140
Oh, we used to be that happy.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.809
Wait a minute--
Joe and Bonnie

03:39.844 --> 03:41.577
never used
to spend time together

03:41.612 --> 03:43.045
until they had Susie.

03:43.081 --> 03:46.048
Having a baby seems
to have made them closer.

03:46.084 --> 03:48.851
Babies save relationships!

03:50.121 --> 03:52.321
Oh, look at you--
you're flyin'!

03:52.356 --> 03:53.823
Okay, thanks, Bonnie.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.858
Next I want
to ride a bike.

03:55.893 --> 03:57.860
That's it, Rupert!
That's how Brian and I

03:57.895 --> 03:59.595
are going to improve
our relationship.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.163
We're going to have a baby!

04:01.199 --> 04:02.965
I say, this is my best idea

04:03.000 --> 04:05.167
since I robbed
a Joseph A. Bank.

04:06.304 --> 04:08.704
Three suits for 99 bucks?!

04:08.740 --> 04:11.107
Take me to jail!

04:14.278 --> 04:16.645
All right,
I want tonight to be perfect.

04:16.681 --> 04:18.647
I'm gonna lay it all out
for Brian

04:18.683 --> 04:20.483
why we should have
a baby together.

04:20.518 --> 04:22.852
I don't know, I haven't
even thought about that.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.587
Why are you so obsessed
with circumcision?

04:24.622 --> 04:26.922
Oh, hey, look, you made
a little dinner party.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.924
Hi, Rupert.
He won't be joining us.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.192
Get up!

04:30.228 --> 04:31.794
Please, sit.

04:31.829 --> 04:33.362
You, uh... you okay?

04:33.397 --> 04:36.065
I'm terrific. And that is
so sweet of you to ask.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.535
You really are a natural
caregiver, aren't you?

04:39.570 --> 04:40.970
Mm. Mm.

04:41.005 --> 04:42.972
Do you mind not texting?

04:43.007 --> 04:45.007
Sorry, sorry.
Just finishing right now.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.108
Almost done.

04:46.144 --> 04:47.810
There, all finished

04:47.845 --> 04:50.212
riiiight...

04:50.248 --> 04:52.081
now.

04:52.116 --> 04:53.482
Thhhhere.

04:53.518 --> 04:55.936
Thanks. So, I wanted
to talk to you about...

04:55.936 --> 04:58.121
A-Are you just gonna
leave it on the table?

04:58.145 --> 04:58.755
I-I won't look at it.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.223
Great. So, I wanted to...
You're looking at it.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.625
Sorry. Work.
It's not work.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.627
It'll just take a second.
I-I normally wouldn't do this,

05:04.662 --> 05:06.829
but I was already kind of
in the middle of something,

05:06.864 --> 05:08.330
and I just need
to quickly respond,

05:08.366 --> 05:10.166
and there I am

05:10.201 --> 05:12.201
finiiished.

05:13.638 --> 05:15.137
Ah, yeah.

05:15.173 --> 05:17.640
Okay, just
a few more worrrds...

05:17.675 --> 05:19.642
annnd...

05:19.677 --> 05:20.810
d-done.

05:20.845 --> 05:22.244
Sorry.
Okay, so...

05:22.280 --> 05:24.446
Nah, nah, I'm
not gonna get it.

05:24.482 --> 05:26.615
Then maybe we can
take it off the table.

05:26.651 --> 05:27.850
No, no, just keep going.

05:28.986 --> 05:30.753
I was thinking,
we should talk

05:30.788 --> 05:32.621
about having a...

05:32.657 --> 05:35.457
This isn't fun for me,
watching you text.

05:35.493 --> 05:37.726
No, no, this is great.
Mm, mm, mm. Yum.

05:37.762 --> 05:40.496
But I-I got to go.
I have a date.

05:40.531 --> 05:42.431
This is serious, Rupert.
I'm losing him.

05:42.466 --> 05:44.333
If we're going to fix
this relationship,

05:44.368 --> 05:47.369
we need a baby
and we need it now.

05:50.675 --> 05:53.108
I'm just going to take
a little bit of his DNA,

05:53.144 --> 05:57.279
and soon we'll be proud parents,
like Ron Livingston's parents.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.914
You know,
our son's a famous actor.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.182
Really?
What's his name?

06:00.218 --> 06:02.151
Oh, um...

06:02.186 --> 06:03.485
he's, uh...

06:03.521 --> 06:06.021
he was, like, the main guy
in<i> Office Space.</i>

06:06.057 --> 06:07.623
Yeah. What else?

06:07.658 --> 06:09.458
Uh... he has dark hair...

06:09.493 --> 06:11.760
I don't know,
was he in<i> Black Hawk Down?</i>

06:11.796 --> 06:14.763
Uh, he was in, like, at least
five<i> Sex "in" the Citys.</i>

06:14.799 --> 06:17.399
What is his name?
What<i> is</i> his name?

06:17.435 --> 06:19.635
Is your son
Ron Livingston?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.637
Yes!
Oh, God! Thank God!

06:21.672 --> 06:23.839
Ron Livingston!
Thank you!

06:23.875 --> 06:26.208
That has been bugging me
all day.

06:29.547 --> 06:31.914
Okay, let's see.
Now, what are the ingredients

06:31.949 --> 06:34.516
to a viral Internet video?

06:34.552 --> 06:36.819
Cats.
Yes, cats. Good.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.321
Uh, uh, people reacting
to watching gross stuff.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.724
Oh, yeah, 'cause they're like,
"Rah! That's gross!

06:41.759 --> 06:44.026
Can I get a soda?
What? No.

06:44.061 --> 06:46.629
Th-This is, like, the worst time
to ask for a soda.

06:46.664 --> 06:47.528
Unbelievable.

06:47.552 --> 06:49.532
You know what, we should
just go out and start filming.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.667
'Cause I think we're
really gonna surprise everyone.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.536

in his first talking picture.

06:54.572 --> 06:56.138
♪ ♪Here we go.

06:56.173 --> 06:59.608
I'm moving through the scene
and I slam the door.

06:59.644 --> 07:02.011
Oh, no!
I slammed it too hard,

07:02.046 --> 07:05.514
and the house
is gonna squash me!

07:05.549 --> 07:07.983
Oh, it turned out
that window was there.

07:08.019 --> 07:10.586
Pause for laugh and amazement.

07:15.092 --> 07:16.792
All right, Rupert,

07:16.827 --> 07:18.794
the fertilization device
is complete.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.930
This will impregnate me
with the child

07:20.965 --> 07:24.066
that will bring Brian and me
back together!

07:24.101 --> 07:26.268
First, I add
Brian's hair and saliva,

07:26.304 --> 07:27.970
and some preschool applications,

07:28.005 --> 07:30.406
because we are
already way behind.

07:30.441 --> 07:32.875
There. Now I just have
to get into the machine,

07:32.910 --> 07:35.945
and then the machine does
whatever it has to do to me

07:35.980 --> 07:37.746
in order to successfully
impregnate me.

07:37.782 --> 07:41.283
We do not judge the machine.
We do not judge Stewie.

07:43.321 --> 07:45.654
Good-bye, body.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.957
You're gonna watch me
get pregnant.

07:47.992 --> 07:50.993
I want to look at you
when it happens.

07:51.996 --> 07:54.096
Yeah, you watch me,
bitch.

08:24.662 --> 08:26.128
Good morning, Brian.

08:26.163 --> 08:27.763
What is that?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.699
I smell pee.
Yes, you do, Brian.

08:33.871 --> 08:35.471
Oh, my God, that
thing's positive!

08:35.506 --> 08:38.107
Is Lois pregnant again?
No...

08:38.142 --> 08:39.775
<i>Meg</i> is pregnant?

08:39.810 --> 08:41.410
You're getting warmer.

08:43.647 --> 08:46.148
Wha... What have you done?

08:46.183 --> 08:48.283
I think you mean,
what have<i> we</i> done?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.518
What?!

08:49.553 --> 08:51.620
Brian... we're pregnant!

08:51.655 --> 08:53.922
Oh, my God!
And in 18 years,

08:53.958 --> 08:55.991
he's going
to move away!

09:00.554 --> 09:02.454
You're pregnant
with<i> our</i> baby?!

09:02.489 --> 09:04.056
How could this
even happen?!

09:04.091 --> 09:06.725
Simple. I took your DNA
and inserted it

09:06.760 --> 09:09.861
into my temporary uterus
through my fertilization device.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.163
Oh, my God,
you're serious!

09:11.198 --> 09:13.865
People are gonna think I
had sex with a male baby

09:13.901 --> 09:15.200
and then got him pregnant!

09:15.235 --> 09:17.669
Oh, thank you for finding a way
to make it sound horrible.

09:17.705 --> 09:19.104
We can't have
a baby, Stewie!

09:19.139 --> 09:21.573
Is this about money?
Because I have a bit saved.

09:21.608 --> 09:23.275
We could even use
my old crib.

09:23.310 --> 09:24.976
<i>You</i> use your old crib!
Oh, right.

09:25.012 --> 09:26.812
Stewie, you have
to get rid of it.

09:26.847 --> 09:29.481
"Get rid of it"? You know,
why don't you just say it?

09:29.516 --> 09:30.782
Say the word, Brian.

09:30.818 --> 09:33.351
I want to hear you say it.
Abortion! Abortion!

09:33.387 --> 09:36.054
You need to get a big fat
abortion right this second!

09:36.090 --> 09:37.522
You can't even say it.

09:37.558 --> 09:38.990
I think I'm
gonna throw up.

09:39.026 --> 09:40.358
Oh, save the cheap theatrics.

09:40.394 --> 09:42.327
This isn't one of your
crappy short stories.

09:42.362 --> 09:44.529
This is real life,
mister, so man up!

09:44.565 --> 09:46.431
You are getting an
abortion, Stewie.

09:46.467 --> 09:49.000
I will not! Our child
is growing inside me!

09:49.036 --> 09:50.569
Stop talking like that!

09:50.604 --> 09:52.704
A-And how do you
even know it's mine?

09:52.740 --> 09:54.372
How dare you!

09:54.408 --> 09:55.941
So I'm just some slut?!

09:55.976 --> 09:57.943
Well, this slut
is having your baby!

09:57.978 --> 09:59.511
Why would you
even do this?

09:59.546 --> 10:00.746
I thought
you'd be happy.

10:00.781 --> 10:02.714
I mean, you have
all these amazing qualities,

10:02.750 --> 10:04.349
and I'm kind of
good-looking.

10:04.384 --> 10:06.017
I mean,
I'm no model, but...

10:06.053 --> 10:07.719
Well, certainly
not a runway model.

10:07.755 --> 10:09.721
I'd-I'd be more
catalogue, probably.

10:09.757 --> 10:11.823
You know what?
Why<i> not</i> a runway model?

10:11.859 --> 10:13.658
Why not? Why am I
always apologizing

10:13.694 --> 10:15.827
for how good-looking I am?
I'm sick of it.

10:15.863 --> 10:18.563
I can model in Paris.
We could take the baby with us.

10:18.599 --> 10:20.999
We could be that kind of family.
What do you think?

10:21.034 --> 10:22.834
Is it dead?

10:22.870 --> 10:24.202
You hit me!

10:24.238 --> 10:27.172
What kind of monster
hits a pregnant toddler!

10:27.207 --> 10:31.243
If you ever lay a finger on me again,
I'll burn you in your bed.

10:31.278 --> 10:33.879
Could... could you
do that now, please?

10:37.785 --> 10:39.618
All right, Peter,
get the camera ready.

10:39.653 --> 10:41.153
I got a viral
Internet video

10:41.188 --> 10:44.389
that's gonna go straight
to the top of the charts.

10:44.424 --> 10:45.857
Hi, I'm Joe Swanson,

10:45.893 --> 10:48.727
and this is 30 impressions
in 30 seconds.

10:48.762 --> 10:50.328
"Show me the money."

10:50.364 --> 10:51.364
"Oh, behave."

10:51.365 --> 10:53.198
"Good morning, Vietnam."

10:53.233 --> 10:55.934
"Wait until they get a load
of me," said the Joker.

10:55.969 --> 10:58.670
Some of these I'm paraphrasing.

11:02.376 --> 11:04.409
Hey, I need you to
take me to the doctor

11:04.444 --> 11:06.178
for my prenatal
vitamins.

11:06.213 --> 11:07.445
I'm not taking you anywhere.

11:07.481 --> 11:09.047
Geez, how far along are you?

11:09.082 --> 11:11.483
I'm not really sure.
Two days, six months...

11:11.518 --> 11:13.552
there's a certain amount of
guesswork involved in this.

11:13.587 --> 11:15.620
Oh, and while I'm pregnant,
I'm going to need you

11:15.656 --> 11:17.622
to change the cat litter.
We don't have a cat.

11:17.658 --> 11:19.958
Ugh. Please don't
fight me on this.

11:19.993 --> 11:22.027
Oh, my back is killing me.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.296
And I've also been
experiencing a little...

11:24.331 --> 11:26.298
morning sickness.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.434
It's for the baby,
it's for the baby.

11:32.906 --> 11:34.739
You look ridiculous
like that.

11:34.775 --> 11:37.008
Not too ridiculous for you
to put a baby in me.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.344
Okay, Raylene,
I'm Dr. Hartman.

11:39.379 --> 11:41.012
Now, before we begin,
I want you to know

11:41.048 --> 11:42.681
the record is just
past my watch.

11:42.716 --> 11:45.350
Well, it takes two people
to break a record.

11:45.385 --> 11:47.352
You look a little young.
How old are you?

11:47.387 --> 11:50.088
Uh, 13? 14?

11:50.123 --> 11:53.258
15. B-But he didn't force
himself on me.

11:53.293 --> 11:54.793
I wanted it, too.

11:54.828 --> 11:56.728
Well, that's
the important thing.

11:56.763 --> 11:58.063
That's odd.

11:58.098 --> 12:00.866
Your vagina seems to have
a penis and two testicles.

12:00.901 --> 12:02.534
Oh, right. I, uh...

12:02.569 --> 12:04.936
sneezed real hard
and all that came out.

12:04.972 --> 12:06.271
Ah, that explains it.

12:06.306 --> 12:08.139
Could you do that thing
where you take some fluid

12:08.175 --> 12:10.942
and tell me if it's going
to be an imbecile or a cretin?

12:10.978 --> 12:12.410
Oh, not to worry,
there are places

12:12.446 --> 12:14.012
where those people
can be warehoused.

12:14.047 --> 12:15.680
But from strictly
eyeballing you,

12:15.716 --> 12:16.948
I'd say everything
looks fine.

12:16.984 --> 12:18.683
Oh, that's wonderful.

12:18.719 --> 12:21.353
Now, Brian, did you have
any questions for the doctor?

12:21.388 --> 12:24.222
Yeah. Are there a lot of
stairs in this building?

12:26.593 --> 12:28.727
God, we need<i> so</i> much stuff.

12:28.762 --> 12:31.396
Look at how tiny all these
clothes are. It's so adorable.

12:31.431 --> 12:33.665
I mean, what kind of feet
can fit into these shoes?

12:33.700 --> 12:34.700
Your feet!

12:34.701 --> 12:36.001
That's getting old, you know.

12:36.036 --> 12:38.003
You better get on
board with this.

12:38.038 --> 12:40.071
Aw, how far along are you?

12:40.107 --> 12:42.340
Eight months.
You look amazing.

12:42.376 --> 12:45.076
Let me ask you, are you leaking?
Because I've been leaking.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.411
How old are you?

12:46.446 --> 12:48.613
How old are<i> you?</i>
You look like you're 40,

12:48.649 --> 12:51.216
which means whatever you've got
in there is 100% brain-damaged.

12:51.251 --> 12:52.884
All right,
you have a good day.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.853
I hated that lady.

12:59.326 --> 13:01.960
I like these.
These are good. Very classy.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.628
This feels
incredibly wrong.

13:03.664 --> 13:06.164
Oh, we're going to want these,
Brian, believe me.

13:06.199 --> 13:07.966
You can't see
my nipples, can you?

13:08.001 --> 13:09.301
They're getting really large,

13:09.336 --> 13:11.303
and I'm not sure
if I'm completely covering them.

13:11.338 --> 13:13.738
Eh, you know what?
We'll see what we see.

13:13.774 --> 13:14.906
Let's get a few candids.

13:14.942 --> 13:17.642
Dad, can I get one of your head
on the belly?

13:17.678 --> 13:21.446
Oh, "Dad."
I just got emotional.

I'm having such a craving
for burgers.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.181
It's like my body is
just craving red meat.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.851
And mint chip ice cream.
But only mint chip.

14:32.886 --> 14:34.686
Any other ice cream
makes me want to puke.

14:34.721 --> 14:36.621
Isn't that weird?
Yes, Stewie,

14:36.656 --> 14:38.757
that's the one weird thing
in all this.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.092
What are you looking at?
Go push your buttons.

14:41.128 --> 14:42.427
My husband'll kick your ass.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.362
Stop saying
I'm your husband.

14:44.398 --> 14:47.298
Brian, I need you to
take me to the hospital.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.633
Why?

14:48.668 --> 14:50.635
My water just broke.
Oh, my God!

14:50.670 --> 14:52.771
It's okay. Don't panic.
Call the doula.

14:52.806 --> 14:54.372
Brian, you've got
to call the doula!

14:54.408 --> 14:56.374
Doula? I-I don't
even know what that is!

14:56.410 --> 14:58.443
It's a divorced woman who
knows about lady parts

14:58.478 --> 15:00.645
and cheers you on.
Let's go!

15:05.118 --> 15:07.485
You're gonna have
to drive a little faster!

15:07.521 --> 15:09.154
I'm already going
over the speed limit.

15:09.189 --> 15:11.356
Too late! Pull over!
It's starting to come out!

15:11.391 --> 15:14.025
Of where?
I'm not sure exactly.

15:15.562 --> 15:18.129
Brian, I'm going to need you
to deliver the baby.

15:18.165 --> 15:20.999
Uh, uh, o-okay, c-can you wait a
second while I put a towel down?

15:21.034 --> 15:22.803
I don't want anything
to get on the seats.

15:22.803 --> 15:23.436
Oh, no, of course.

15:23.437 --> 15:25.737
Our first priority should be
to keep the vinyl clean.

15:25.772 --> 15:28.239
Oh, God. Oh, God,
it's coming! Oh...

15:28.275 --> 15:29.574
Can you see the head?

15:29.609 --> 15:30.742
I don't know
where to look!

15:30.777 --> 15:32.443
Well, maybe you should look
at the part of me

15:32.476 --> 15:33.675
where there's
a baby coming out!

15:35.379 --> 15:38.013
How did Murphy Brown
make this look so easy?!

15:38.048 --> 15:39.488
Careful, don't get
anything on the...

15:39.816 --> 15:41.115
...seats.

15:41.172 --> 15:43.186
Oh, God,
I think another one's coming!

15:43.187 --> 15:43.915
I don't see it!

15:43.939 --> 15:45.655
I think
it's coming out of my mouth!

15:45.656 --> 15:47.889
There's more!

15:47.925 --> 15:49.491
And they're coming out
of everywhere!

15:49.526 --> 15:52.093
Ah! Kill me!
This hurts too much!

15:52.129 --> 15:54.095
Holy!
What is happening?!

15:54.131 --> 15:56.164
I don't know!
Brian, save the placenta.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.699
Do you even have a placenta?

15:57.734 --> 15:59.835
Well, whatever comes
out, save it. I want to eat it.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.570
Oh, God,
they're crawling all over me!

16:01.605 --> 16:02.737
How many are there now?

16:02.773 --> 16:05.073
Four, five, six, seven.

16:05.108 --> 16:07.242
Mazel tov!

16:22.922 --> 16:25.422
I just put Jack and
Rose down for their nap.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.925
And I'm trying to keep the more
attractive ones in this area.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.193
This is a nightmare.

16:29.228 --> 16:31.261
Oh, I caught two of them
trying to eat each other,

16:31.297 --> 16:33.597
so that's something we
need to watch out for.

16:33.632 --> 16:36.233
Look, Bri, that one
looks just like you.

16:37.636 --> 16:40.070
Huh. Well, you know what?
I guess he does.

16:40.106 --> 16:41.939
You know, I was
actually thinking,

16:41.974 --> 16:44.808
this could be a chance for you
to finally make things right.

16:44.844 --> 16:46.310
What? What do you mean?

16:46.345 --> 16:48.645
Well, you do have a son
that you were never there for.

16:48.681 --> 16:51.148
This is your opportunity
to do things differently.

16:51.183 --> 16:53.417
Wow. Maybe you're right.

16:53.452 --> 16:57.254
I suppose I could give it a try.

16:57.289 --> 16:58.289
There you go.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.057
Aw, Dick really
likes you.

17:00.092 --> 17:01.092
I like Dick.

17:01.093 --> 17:02.393
You like Dick!

17:02.428 --> 17:05.696
His name's not Dick,
you idiot. It's Finn.

17:09.335 --> 17:10.975
All right, let's check
our YouTube channel

17:11.003 --> 17:12.569
and see how we're doing.

17:12.605 --> 17:15.239
Boy, they just went right
after Cleveland, didn't they?

17:15.274 --> 17:17.908
Geez, that word looks even
harsher when it's in all caps.

17:17.943 --> 17:20.911
Wow, people really seem to hate
everything we put on here.

17:20.946 --> 17:23.247
That sucks.
And I worked really hard

17:23.282 --> 17:25.649
on taking a picture of myself
every day for a year

17:25.684 --> 17:27.985
and then setting the photos
to an emotional song.

18:28.781 --> 18:30.481
Why are you being
such a jerk?

18:30.516 --> 18:32.349
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I just...

18:32.384 --> 18:34.818
I just feel like
once I get them on a schedule,

18:34.854 --> 18:36.854
everything will be fine.

18:42.361 --> 18:45.128
I can't believe we couldn't
come up with a viral video.

18:45.164 --> 18:47.731
We should've just gotten Jimmy
Fallon to do any lame thing.

18:49.468 --> 18:52.436
Coming up, a white waiter
at a Chinese restaurant?

18:52.471 --> 18:54.471
We'll get you the facts
on this bizarre story.

18:54.507 --> 18:56.406
But first,
this week's viral video,

18:56.442 --> 18:59.109
"Fat Kid Hustles
Through Crosswalk."

18:59.144 --> 19:02.479
<i>Here it is. Here's little</i>
<i>Chubbo pulling up the rear.</i>

19:03.682 --> 19:05.883
<i>Oh, he's got to get moving now.</i>

19:11.724 --> 19:14.892
<i>That's right. Don't let your</i>
<i>chocolate levels get too low.</i>

19:20.900 --> 19:22.533
I can't believe
Chris gets four million hits

19:22.568 --> 19:23.867
just crossing the street.

19:23.903 --> 19:25.869
I guess we were
trying too hard.

19:25.905 --> 19:28.205
Hey, I went by your house
the other day.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.740
Is your baby pregnant?

19:29.775 --> 19:32.442
I don't know. Lois is
in charge of the kids.

19:40.319 --> 19:41.818
Stewie, this is awful.

19:41.854 --> 19:43.687
I don't know why anyone
would want to be a parent,

19:43.722 --> 19:45.355
especially
to four children.

19:45.391 --> 19:47.357
Four? I thought
we were down to five.

19:47.393 --> 19:49.526
Yeah, the deaf one
didn't hear Joe's lawnmower.

19:49.562 --> 19:51.261
Oh. That's really upsetting.

19:51.297 --> 19:52.729
I-I can't take this
anymore, Stewie.

19:52.765 --> 19:54.264
I-I'm sorry. I got
to get out of here.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.599
What? Where are you going?

19:55.634 --> 19:56.934
Stop doing that!

19:56.969 --> 19:58.268
I need a break,
all right?

19:58.304 --> 20:00.304
I-I j... I just got
to get away for a couple weeks.

20:00.306 --> 20:01.538
A couple weeks?

20:01.574 --> 20:03.540
Y-You're not leaving me
alone with these things.

20:03.576 --> 20:06.209
The whole point of this was for
us to spend more time together.

20:06.245 --> 20:08.579
Wait, what are you talking
about? The whole point of what?

20:08.614 --> 20:10.581
Well, you've been so distant
lately.

20:10.616 --> 20:13.584
I thought if we had a baby it
would bring us closer together.

20:13.619 --> 20:15.252
What? I was only distant

20:15.287 --> 20:16.987
because you've been so moody
lately.

20:17.022 --> 20:18.522
I thought you needed more space.

20:18.557 --> 20:20.157
I always want
to hang out with you.

20:20.192 --> 20:22.192
Well, I was only moody
because you were so distant!

20:22.194 --> 20:24.161
I always want
to hang out with you, too!

20:24.196 --> 20:25.929
Oh, my God.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.800
So we didn't have
to do any of this.

20:29.835 --> 20:32.302
I-I guess not.

20:32.338 --> 20:33.904
How attached to them are you?

20:33.939 --> 20:35.806
Not at all.
Yeah, me either.

20:38.744 --> 20:40.177
This is for the best.

20:40.212 --> 20:41.912
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure
they'll be adopted.

20:41.947 --> 20:43.580
Oh, God, yeah.

20:43.616 --> 20:46.049
I'm still keeping all the gifts
from the baby shower.

20:46.085 --> 20:47.985
You had a baby shower?

20:48.020 --> 20:50.204
Oh!

20:50.205 --> 20:52.307
Now this makes it real!

20:52.308 --> 20:54.468
Oh, my goodness. That's enough
cake for you, Mary Beth.
