@elder_man

00:36.014 --> 00:37.985
Oh, this is a big
moment for Stewie.

00:38.319 --> 00:39.784
Big moment?
Come on, Lois,

00:39.825 --> 00:41.825
he's moving from the green room
to the purple room.

00:41.830 --> 00:43.568
And just last month,
we had to come here

00:43.602 --> 00:45.740
when he went into the green room
from the yellow room.

00:45.774 --> 00:47.207
Oh, don't remind me.

00:47.241 --> 00:49.284
I'm gonna start crying
all over again.

00:49.318 --> 00:51.225
I told work he was
getting dialysis,

00:51.259 --> 00:53.229
so I got the whole day off.

00:53.263 --> 00:55.966
Stewie Griffin,
welcome to the purple room.

00:59.169 --> 01:01.273
Wow, look at that!
This must be how

01:01.307 --> 01:04.011
the Tin Man felt
when he finally got his heart.

01:04.045 --> 01:07.817
And as for you, Tin Man,
a 19-year-old kid in Cincinnati

01:07.851 --> 01:10.352
was struck by
a drunk driver last night.

01:10.386 --> 01:12.784
And so... you've
got your heart.

01:12.818 --> 01:14.784
You know, it's
kind of hitting me now

01:14.826 --> 01:17.362
that maybe I was thinking
more metaphorically.

01:17.396 --> 01:19.730
Oh, no-- you said
you wanted a heart

01:19.764 --> 01:21.267
over and over again.

01:21.301 --> 01:23.468
You sang that
whole song about it.

01:23.502 --> 01:26.502
We bumped you right up
to the top of the donor list.

01:26.543 --> 01:29.006
Which means there's
a father of three in Nebraska

01:29.040 --> 01:31.176
who now has
a very little chance

01:31.217 --> 01:34.184
of receiving one
within the next 24 hours.

01:35.219 --> 01:37.985
So feel good about that.

01:38.019 --> 01:40.956
Now, who wanted
the brain?

01:46.569 --> 01:49.340
"And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain,

01:49.374 --> 01:51.880
he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer."

01:51.914 --> 01:53.891
All right, take it
down a notch, Stewie.

01:53.925 --> 01:56.432
You just happen to be the
offspring of a generation

01:56.466 --> 01:58.203
that celebrates their
kids for nothing.

01:58.237 --> 01:59.773
Everybody's always
getting an award.

01:59.807 --> 02:01.408
Well, you've never
gotten an award.

02:01.442 --> 02:03.914
Uh, what's that bowl
that says "good boy"?

02:03.948 --> 02:07.118
You know, that was
our old dog's dish.

02:07.152 --> 02:08.393
Hey, how are you?

02:08.427 --> 02:10.901
I-I was just putting this cake
in my purse for a friend.

02:10.935 --> 02:13.033
Listen, you probably get
asked this all the time,

02:13.075 --> 02:14.676
but have you
ever modeled?

02:14.710 --> 02:16.816
I've never even been
in a picture before.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.723
Well, I don't just
shoot school events.

02:18.757 --> 02:21.061
My real passion is discovering
talent like yours.

02:21.095 --> 02:23.063
Really? You think
I could model?

02:23.097 --> 02:25.169
Sure. You've got
a great look.

02:25.203 --> 02:28.140
Here's my number-- give me
a call if you're interested.

02:28.174 --> 02:30.446
Wow, me being a model!

02:30.480 --> 02:33.513
I mean, I guess
crazier things have happened.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.689
Heh-hoo!

02:41.230 --> 02:44.093
We now return
to<i> Rocky Dennis the Menace.</i>

02:45.864 --> 02:47.333
What the hell?

02:47.367 --> 02:48.869
Oh, it's you.

02:48.903 --> 02:52.605
My wife said I'm not allowed
to get mad at you anymore.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.275
All right, see you later.
Where are you off to?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.939
Actually, I met
a photographer

02:56.973 --> 02:58.275
at Stewie's
school yesterday,

02:58.309 --> 03:00.475
and he wants me
to model for him.

03:02.444 --> 03:04.450
Lois, please send these
back to the factory.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.650
I believe they're defective.
Oh, my God, Peter,

03:06.684 --> 03:08.713
did you just rip
your own ears off?

03:08.755 --> 03:10.049
It was the easiest way

03:10.091 --> 03:12.288
to let her know the news
was ridiculous.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.953
You know, it
would be nice

03:13.995 --> 03:15.994
if you guys believed
in me just once.

03:16.028 --> 03:17.660
You're being
terrible parents.

03:17.702 --> 03:19.964
Even worse than
John Edwards.

03:19.998 --> 03:21.804
Kids, we need
to talk.

03:21.838 --> 03:23.468
Your mama has cancer.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.636
And it's made me
incredibly horny.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.676
Take care.

03:31.214 --> 03:33.011
You know, Brian,
I gave some thought

03:33.045 --> 03:35.514
to what you said the other day,
and I realized you're right.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.849
Moving to the purple room
is not an achievement.

03:37.883 --> 03:39.081
Stewie, what are
you doing here?

03:39.115 --> 03:40.515
I asked Peter to
read my manuscript,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.583
and he said he had to
take you to dialysis.

03:42.617 --> 03:43.918
Anyway, you got me thinking.

03:43.952 --> 03:46.423
I've spent my entire life
in that ivory tower,

03:46.457 --> 03:49.087
learning from pop-up books
and animal sound machines,

03:49.121 --> 03:51.423
instead of actually
experiencing the world.

03:51.457 --> 03:53.263
That's why I got this.

03:53.297 --> 03:55.926
I'm gonna take a year off,
hit the open road

03:55.967 --> 03:57.261
and live life
to the fullest.

03:57.295 --> 03:58.431
You're a baby.

03:58.465 --> 03:59.599
How'd you
afford a car?

03:59.633 --> 04:01.535
Don't worry, I got
a great price on it.

04:01.569 --> 04:03.733
You know how good I am
at making a deal.

04:03.775 --> 04:06.236
All right, I have $50
for the first person

04:06.270 --> 04:08.542
with a paper clip
and rouge in their purse.

04:08.576 --> 04:10.542
Ooh, ooh!
Monty, Monty!

04:10.576 --> 04:12.381
Paper clip and rouge!
Paper clip and rouge!

04:12.415 --> 04:13.708
Why do you have rouge?

04:13.750 --> 04:15.550
I don't know, it's been
in the purse for ages.

04:15.581 --> 04:16.714
Why do you
have a purse?

04:16.748 --> 04:18.712
For the paper clips
and rouge, you idiot!

04:18.746 --> 04:20.543
What are you gonna buy
with that $50?

04:20.585 --> 04:22.248
Purses and rouge!

04:27.826 --> 04:29.558
Sorry to use your
bathroom so much.

04:29.592 --> 04:30.789
I'm just really nervous.

04:30.823 --> 04:32.955
You have nothing
to be nervous about.

04:32.989 --> 04:34.186
This is gonna be fun.

04:34.228 --> 04:36.718
Okay, well, here goes.

04:39.924 --> 04:41.384
All right, Meg,
while we take these,

04:41.418 --> 04:43.055
we can either play
"Freeze Frame"

04:43.089 --> 04:44.718
or "She Works Hard
for the Money."

04:44.760 --> 04:45.853
Which would you prefer?

04:45.887 --> 04:47.020
Can we play both?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.857
Sure.

04:48.891 --> 04:52.190
♪ She works hard for the money ♪

04:52.224 --> 04:54.685
♪ So hard for it, honey ♪

04:55.896 --> 04:57.528
♪ She works hard for the money ♪

04:57.562 --> 04:58.928
♪ So you better... ♪

04:58.962 --> 05:01.127
Well, that was a stupid idea.

05:01.169 --> 05:03.032
But you-- you were phenomenal.

05:03.066 --> 05:04.538
You really think so?

05:04.572 --> 05:06.042
Here, have a look.

05:06.076 --> 05:07.706
I think these turned out great.

05:12.581 --> 05:15.050
Wait, Ben--
are they all of my feet?

05:15.084 --> 05:17.713
Well, Meg, the thing is--
my name's Evan, by the way--

05:17.755 --> 05:20.889
a lot of people will pay good
money for pictures of sexy feet.

05:20.923 --> 05:23.384
Foot-fetish porn sites
are a huge business.

05:23.426 --> 05:25.223
But when you asked
me to model,

05:25.257 --> 05:26.886
I thought you meant
real modeling.

05:26.928 --> 05:28.389
This is real modeling.

05:28.423 --> 05:30.157
And you could be
our next big star.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.325
Really?

05:31.358 --> 05:32.556
I don't know...

05:32.598 --> 05:34.227
Come on,
it could be great.

05:34.261 --> 05:35.900
You'll meet lots
of famous people.

05:35.934 --> 05:37.228
Like Charles Barkley.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.396
Hi, Meg.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.900
You have nice
"feetses."

05:39.934 --> 05:41.571
I want to put 'em
both in my mouth

05:41.605 --> 05:44.066
and then make a slapping sound
on my bald head with 'em.

05:44.108 --> 05:46.033
We have a tranq gun
if he gets rough.

05:50.695 --> 05:53.996
♪ Highway run ♪

05:54.038 --> 05:56.333
♪ Into the midnight sun... ♪

05:57.376 --> 05:59.005
Meg, why are you
home so early?

05:59.039 --> 06:00.940
Yeah, I thought you were
doing your modeling thing.

06:00.974 --> 06:01.940
I was.

06:01.974 --> 06:03.475
But what...
what's happening here?

06:03.509 --> 06:05.443
Well, not that it's
any of your business, Meg,

06:05.477 --> 06:07.949
but this is why we've been
married as long as we have.

06:07.983 --> 06:09.611
We do things together.

06:09.653 --> 06:11.451
You think 20 years
just happens?

06:11.484 --> 06:12.785
No, it does not.

06:12.819 --> 06:14.248
Now, tell us fast
about your nonsense,

06:14.282 --> 06:16.120
so I can plow your mother
on the staircase.

06:16.154 --> 06:17.784
Yeah, what kind of
photo shoot was it?

06:17.818 --> 06:20.288
Did they take a picture
of you eating a whole pizza pie

06:20.322 --> 06:21.792
next to an astonished chef?

06:23.291 --> 06:26.466
Actually, Evan thinks
I'm a natural

06:26.501 --> 06:28.803
and that I'm gonna be
a huge success.

06:28.837 --> 06:30.635
He thinks I could be
a famous model.

06:30.669 --> 06:31.803
You, famous?

06:31.837 --> 06:32.970
Oh, come on, Meg.

06:33.004 --> 06:34.484
Your only chance at fame
would've been

06:34.507 --> 06:35.840
as the dog on "Frasier."

06:35.874 --> 06:38.839
Well, of course I respect
my father. He's a vet.

06:38.873 --> 06:39.838
Woof!

06:39.872 --> 06:41.341
Not that kind of vet.

06:46.181 --> 06:48.978
So, where exactly
are we going anyway?

06:49.012 --> 06:51.314
Brian, I think the road has
a way of telling you

06:51.348 --> 06:52.714
where you're going.

06:54.916 --> 06:55.916
There.

06:55.924 --> 06:57.721
Rhode Island
Folk Festival.

06:57.755 --> 06:59.489
The road has spoken.

06:59.523 --> 07:01.003
Huh, that actually
sounds kind of fun.

07:01.027 --> 07:02.162
See, Brian?

07:02.196 --> 07:03.827
This trip's already off
to a great start.

07:03.861 --> 07:05.660
Certainly better than
that retreat we went on

07:05.702 --> 07:07.868
with the Quahog
Baptist Choir.

07:07.902 --> 07:11.700

Car?

07:31.625 --> 07:32.991
Come on.

07:33.033 --> 07:37.030
Let's just see what we see
and keep it to ourselves.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.966
Hey, Evan.

07:42.008 --> 07:43.438
Oh, good, Meg,
you're here.

07:43.472 --> 07:46.541
Grab a pair of dirty socks and
meet me by the tub of dead mice.

07:46.575 --> 07:48.373
Actually, Evan,

07:48.407 --> 07:49.846
I've been thinking
about this,

07:49.880 --> 07:52.350
and I'm not sure being a
foot-fetish model is for me.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.350
What?

07:53.384 --> 07:54.350
You can't quit.

07:54.384 --> 07:55.685
You're an overnight
sensation.

07:55.719 --> 07:56.780
I am?

07:59.792 --> 08:02.592
You got 35,000 views
in one night.

08:02.626 --> 08:04.593
And none of them got past
the fourth picture.

08:04.627 --> 08:05.627
What does that mean?

08:05.636 --> 08:06.602
Oh...

08:06.636 --> 08:07.636
They love you.

08:07.637 --> 08:08.772
And look
at these comments.

08:08.806 --> 08:09.806
"Who is this?"

08:09.808 --> 08:10.943
"She's beautiful."

08:10.977 --> 08:12.608
A bunch of anti-Muslim stuff.

08:12.643 --> 08:13.643
"Great feet."

08:13.652 --> 08:14.779
You're a hit, Meg.

08:14.821 --> 08:17.453
Wow. That's...
that's amazing.

08:17.487 --> 08:19.792
It's not often that
anyone says anything nice

08:19.826 --> 08:21.296
about any part of me.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.463
But still, I don't...
I don't know.

08:23.497 --> 08:25.966
It's porn-- I never
thought I'd do porn.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.934
I understand
your apprehension, Meg.

08:27.968 --> 08:31.100
That's why I'm going to confuse
you by calling it "erotica."

08:31.134 --> 08:33.266
And besides, think
about all your fans.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.604
I-I guess when you
put it that way...

08:35.638 --> 08:39.306
I wouldn't want to let
down "Drizzlefoot321."

08:39.340 --> 08:41.641
You really think
I can do it, Evan?

08:41.675 --> 08:43.312
Of course you can.

08:43.346 --> 08:46.143
Sometimes people just need a
little encouragement to succeed,

08:46.177 --> 08:48.679
like Jason Biggs got
from his grandfather.

08:48.713 --> 08:52.350
Jason, I want you to
promise me one thing--

08:52.384 --> 08:54.350
always be forgettable.

08:55.888 --> 08:57.718
I will, Grandpa.

08:59.192 --> 09:01.159
Hey, that's just a
regular unattractive guy

09:01.193 --> 09:02.223
who's not famous.

09:02.265 --> 09:04.233
We did it, Grandpa.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.520
What are you doing?

09:16.528 --> 09:17.823
It's 18 and
older, Brian.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.991
If I want to get in,
I need to look the part.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.665
I've also been
working on my banter.

09:22.699 --> 09:24.338
Like, in case somebody
bumps into me--

09:24.372 --> 09:25.667
"Oh, no worries, bro."

09:25.709 --> 09:27.869
Stewie, there's a lot of sex
and drugs at these things.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.007
You sure you're
ready for this?

09:29.049 --> 09:30.344
Of course I am.

09:30.378 --> 09:32.679
I'm tired of living my
life in a tiny little box,

09:32.713 --> 09:34.687
like some sort of
claustrophobic turtle.

09:34.721 --> 09:36.352
Aah! Aah!

09:36.386 --> 09:37.689
Aah! Aah!

09:37.723 --> 09:38.723
Aah!

09:38.725 --> 09:41.197
He scare inside,
he scare outside.

09:41.231 --> 09:42.766
Uh-huh.

09:45.302 --> 09:47.605
Okay, Brian, the key
to these things is to find

09:47.639 --> 09:49.408
a good position
to sit on the ground.

09:49.442 --> 09:51.282
Yeah, cool, I got that
blanket from your trunk.

09:51.314 --> 09:53.776
Oh, yeah, the old scratchy
trunk blanket.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.113
Bring it, use it once,

09:55.147 --> 09:57.820
then put it back in the trunk
for the rest of your life.

09:58.992 --> 09:59.958
Ah, yeah.

09:59.992 --> 10:02.094
Okay, this is already
hurting my hip.

10:02.128 --> 10:03.248
We could probably
just stand.

10:03.264 --> 10:04.494
No, no, we got
the blanket.

10:04.528 --> 10:06.493
All right, let's try
sideways on the elbow.

10:06.535 --> 10:07.661
Ow, no, that hurts.

10:07.702 --> 10:08.901
Scratchy blanket.

10:08.935 --> 10:10.837
Okay, all right,
let's try sitting on my knees.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.005
Okay, that's good.

10:12.039 --> 10:13.333
Nope. Uh...

10:13.375 --> 10:15.669
Lean back on the palms
until they get weird creases.

10:15.711 --> 10:16.677
No.

10:16.711 --> 10:17.677
All the way back? Nope.

10:17.711 --> 10:19.005
Flat-back, craning to look up?

10:19.047 --> 10:20.173
Terrible.

10:20.215 --> 10:22.349
Balls of feet butt-hover
like a Chinese guy?

10:22.383 --> 10:23.349
Nope.

10:23.383 --> 10:24.750
All right, standing it is.

10:30.965 --> 10:34.134
I got to tell you, Bri,
I am a big fan of sundresses.

10:34.168 --> 10:36.407
Oh, yeah. Every woman
looks good in a sundress.

10:36.441 --> 10:38.735
Yeah, just waiting
for a big gust of wind, right?

10:38.777 --> 10:40.471
Huh? Good gust of wind?

10:40.512 --> 10:42.207
See a couple fannies? Huh?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.480
Give a little bare-hand slap,
a little cup?

10:44.514 --> 10:46.681
Yep, that's what we're here for.
Okay, Stewie.

10:46.715 --> 10:49.153
Yeah. Just give it a little
test tap, see where she's at.

10:49.187 --> 10:50.954
Then you're pushing all up
on that fanny.

10:50.988 --> 10:53.090
Whoa, Stewie.
Yeah! Yeah, "whoa."

10:53.124 --> 10:54.924
Who's this Stewie,
huh? Yeah.

10:54.966 --> 10:56.397
I'll tell you
who this Stewie is.

10:56.431 --> 10:57.551
This is day-drinking Stewie.

10:57.568 --> 10:59.168
On the patrol for fannies.

10:59.202 --> 11:01.167
Fanny! Yeah! Fanny!

11:01.201 --> 11:03.238
What are you looking at?

11:07.207 --> 11:09.109
All right, finished a chapter.

11:09.144 --> 11:12.444
Time to reward myself
with a slow, relaxing yank.

11:12.478 --> 11:15.043
Let's see.
What will it be today?

11:15.085 --> 11:17.578
Time to spin the Wheel of Porn.

11:20.957 --> 11:23.891
All right, foot fetish it is.

11:26.599 --> 11:28.598
Wait a minute.

11:37.274 --> 11:40.042
Oh, my God.

11:42.653 --> 11:45.713
Mom! Dad! Meg is
doing foot porn!

11:45.755 --> 11:47.687
What?! Oh, my God.

11:47.722 --> 11:50.287
Peter, our little girl
is doing pornography!

11:50.321 --> 11:52.422
We got to stop her!
What the hell?

11:52.456 --> 11:54.758
There's an animated version
of you and me doing it.

11:54.792 --> 11:56.421
Who put that on there?

11:57.462 --> 11:58.588
Brian!
Stewie!

11:58.629 --> 12:00.091
Hey, how's it going, man?

12:00.125 --> 12:02.163
Uh, I don't know.
Four different bands said

12:02.197 --> 12:04.362
we've been a great crowd,
so you tell me.

12:04.396 --> 12:06.032
Yeah, I've had a
pretty good day, too.

12:06.066 --> 12:07.695
People keep passing
out and barfing,

12:07.729 --> 12:09.491
and that barf is,
like, free to take.

12:09.525 --> 12:10.529
Awesome.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.422
Plus, I met
the most amazing girl.

12:12.464 --> 12:14.325
Well, I'll tell you this,
she's got to be

12:14.359 --> 12:15.679
the second most
amazing girl here,

12:15.695 --> 12:18.061
because I've met
the most amazing girl.

12:18.095 --> 12:19.862
Oh, here she comes now.
Oh, here she comes now.

12:19.903 --> 12:21.966
Hey, Stewie! Hey, Brian!

12:22.000 --> 12:23.301
Oh, crap.

12:23.335 --> 12:27.106
Wait, how can a music festival
chick like two guys?

12:30.674 --> 12:32.504
As soon as Meg walks
through that door,

12:32.538 --> 12:34.438
I am giving her
a piece of my mind.

12:34.472 --> 12:36.109
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

12:36.143 --> 12:38.444
Wait, you've been
upstairs the whole time?

12:38.478 --> 12:40.379
I figured all that
clomping around up there

12:40.413 --> 12:42.306
was Junior Gorg
from<i> Fraggle Rock.</i>

12:42.348 --> 12:44.113
Is that
what you really thought?

12:44.147 --> 12:45.777
I did.
I really did.

12:45.811 --> 12:47.983
Meg, we know
you've been doing foot porn,

12:48.017 --> 12:50.110
and that is going
to stop right now.

12:50.152 --> 12:52.781
Please. Don't try to act
like you guys care.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.916
Oh, thank God.

12:54.950 --> 12:56.651
Peter!

12:56.685 --> 12:57.987
Meg, we do care.

12:58.021 --> 12:59.988
And we're just trying
to protect you.

13:00.022 --> 13:02.155
Are you kidding?
All you've done is make fun

13:02.189 --> 13:04.627
of anybody possibly thinking
I could be a model.

13:04.661 --> 13:05.963
Well, guess what,

13:05.997 --> 13:08.957
there are people out there
who think I'm beautiful.

13:08.991 --> 13:10.690
That's my ride.

13:10.724 --> 13:14.085
I'm going to a big party
they're throwing in<i> my</i> honor.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.956
Meg, don't you dare walk out
that door, or you're grounded.

13:26.126 --> 13:27.357
Oh, my God!

13:27.399 --> 13:29.630
I can't believe
our daughter's a porn star!

13:29.664 --> 13:31.631
Well, porn actress.

13:31.665 --> 13:34.969
Let's not go crazy on the
Christmas letter, okay, Lois?

13:39.873 --> 13:41.237
Peter, we got to
do something.

13:41.271 --> 13:43.908
Our daughter just left for
some sleazy foot porn party.

13:43.942 --> 13:46.739
I feel like we're getting
invited to less stuff nowadays.

13:46.773 --> 13:48.705
We got to find out
where that party is

13:48.739 --> 13:50.208
and get Meg
out of there!

13:50.242 --> 13:51.975
You're right.
God, what happened?

13:52.009 --> 13:54.802
It seems like just yesterday
she was born.

13:54.844 --> 13:56.841
Mr. Griffin, would you like
to cut the cord?

13:56.875 --> 13:58.438
Sure.

13:58.472 --> 14:02.502
Okay, that wasn't the cord,
and now you've got a girl.

14:02.536 --> 14:06.498
♪ Ooh, oh, Josephine... ♪

14:09.602 --> 14:11.609
Okay, Brian, so we
like the same girl.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.505
There's no reason we can't
be gentlemen about this.

14:13.547 --> 14:14.745
Absolutely.

14:14.779 --> 14:16.943
Our friendship is more important
than any one girl.

14:16.975 --> 14:18.004
Hey, guys.

14:18.046 --> 14:19.244
I got us all
some food.

14:19.278 --> 14:20.340
Oh, great.

14:20.382 --> 14:21.611
Just mash Brian's
pill in there

14:21.645 --> 14:23.577
and smear it on the grass,
he's good to go.

14:23.611 --> 14:24.839
Oh, no, he's kidding.

14:24.881 --> 14:27.073
I-I'm perfectly capable
of taking a pill.

14:41.709 --> 14:42.970
Yep, down the hatch.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.105
Now, Stewie, would you like
your food served to you

14:45.146 --> 14:46.840
as an airplane
or a magic bus?

14:46.874 --> 14:49.774
You two
are so cool and funny.

14:49.808 --> 14:51.374
Brian especially.

14:51.415 --> 14:53.812
Did you happen to read his
tweet about "jumbo shrimp"?

14:54.846 --> 14:56.042
Just a little heads-up.

14:56.084 --> 14:57.378
Stewie still screams,
"What's happening?"

14:57.412 --> 14:58.745
when he gets an erection.

14:58.779 --> 15:00.816
Oh, this is nice, spending
this time together.

15:00.850 --> 15:02.382
Brian, why don't
you show Cassandra

15:02.416 --> 15:03.517
your Boost
Mobile phone?

15:03.551 --> 15:04.685
Stewie has AIDS.

15:04.719 --> 15:06.748
Guys, guys,
there's no reason to fight.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.186
I don't have AIDS,
by the way.

15:08.220 --> 15:09.481
In fact...

15:09.515 --> 15:12.551
I was thinking maybe
we could all have a three-way.

15:12.585 --> 15:14.751
A... a three-way?

15:16.153 --> 15:17.223
I'm in.
Yeah, totally.

15:17.257 --> 15:18.222
Really?

15:18.256 --> 15:19.894
Cool! Let's go.

15:22.093 --> 15:23.691
I'm serious, man.
I'm doing this.

15:23.725 --> 15:24.892
I am, too.
Bring it on.

15:24.926 --> 15:25.926
Don't doubt me, Brian.

15:25.934 --> 15:26.994
I never back down.

15:27.028 --> 15:29.362
Like Boppo, the inflatable
punching clown.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.065
Ah, you're in
big trouble, Boppo.

15:31.099 --> 15:33.468
We told you to take a dive
in the third round,

15:33.502 --> 15:35.007
and you just kept
popping back up.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.407
Let him
have it, boys.

15:42.551 --> 15:43.517
He's pretty tough, boss.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.551
I'll handle this.

15:46.182 --> 15:47.147
Whoa! Boppo!

15:47.181 --> 15:48.347
Take it easy there, pal!

15:48.389 --> 15:49.850
We-we-we was just
playin' with ya!

15:49.884 --> 15:51.649
Yeah, we didn't
mean no harm.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.022
Boppo!

15:58.056 --> 15:59.925
We've got the place
completely surrounded!

15:59.959 --> 16:02.124
We all know how
it's going to end!

16:02.158 --> 16:04.123
Come out with
your hands up, lad!

16:08.791 --> 16:11.657
♪ Bat us around ♪

16:11.691 --> 16:14.159
♪ But we land on our feet... ♪

16:15.857 --> 16:17.726
All right, let's lay
some ground rules here.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.632
You take her left side,
I'll take her right.

16:19.666 --> 16:20.761
What?

16:20.802 --> 16:22.168
Wait, how about
top and bottom,

16:22.202 --> 16:23.295
or front and back?

16:23.337 --> 16:24.831
How about I take
head, shoulders,

16:24.873 --> 16:26.766
knees and toes,
knees and toes?

16:26.800 --> 16:27.934
Okay, you can
have those.

16:27.968 --> 16:30.604
You just gave away
the store, mister.

16:30.638 --> 16:32.108
You guys ready?

16:33.973 --> 16:35.739
'Cause I am.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.813
Ah! What's
happening?!

16:43.151 --> 16:45.886
Is... is this...
is this foreplay?

16:45.920 --> 16:47.086
She's dead.

16:47.128 --> 16:48.926
I think she had
a drug overdose.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.095
Well, just
'cause she's out

16:50.129 --> 16:51.696
doesn't mean the
party's over.

16:51.730 --> 16:53.697
Yes, it does.
We gotta get out of here.

16:53.731 --> 16:55.034
What? We can't
just leave her.

16:55.068 --> 16:56.034
She had nobody.

16:56.067 --> 16:57.633
No family,
no friends.

16:57.675 --> 16:59.072
Really?
How do you know all that?

16:59.106 --> 17:00.135
"All that"?

17:00.169 --> 17:01.774
You said you were
in love with her.

17:01.808 --> 17:03.406
Did you not talk
to her at all?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.774
No, I-I talked to her.

17:04.808 --> 17:07.907
I know she liked...
tents.

17:07.941 --> 17:09.442
And cocaine.

17:09.476 --> 17:12.442
Oh, oh, and how she loved
bleeding from her nose.

17:12.476 --> 17:13.681
You're a monster.

17:13.715 --> 17:16.311
You're even worse
than Dr. Finkelstein.

17:16.345 --> 17:18.477
Igor, did you
get the body?

17:18.511 --> 17:20.117
Yes, master.

17:20.151 --> 17:21.548
You know
what to do.

17:25.450 --> 17:26.647
It's a five!

17:26.681 --> 17:28.279
A five!

17:35.490 --> 17:36.791
Oh, hey, guys.
What's going on?

17:36.825 --> 17:38.926
Quagmire, we need your help
finding Meg.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.493
I would love if you guys
would just call first.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.763
She's run off to some
foot-fetish porn party.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.531
We figured you might
know where it is.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.394
You know, 'cause of
your boners and stuff.

17:47.428 --> 17:48.834
Foot-fetish party, huh?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.770
Well, come on in.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.771
Let me just fire up
the Internet here.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.804
Gonna go to
"Ask Beeves."

17:56.510 --> 17:58.579
Sorry, Joe's Wi-Fi
is really slow today.

17:58.613 --> 18:00.243
Ugh, I know,
it's the worst.

18:00.277 --> 18:02.578
We also use
his cable TV.

18:02.612 --> 18:03.682
I like Joe.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.914
Here we go.

18:04.948 --> 18:06.385
Oh, it's a busy night.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.785
There's a black-tie event--

18:07.819 --> 18:10.246
that's all black
and Thai chicks.

18:10.287 --> 18:12.012
Okay, this must be Meg's thing.

18:12.054 --> 18:14.018
It says there's
a shoe-kake party tonight.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.217
"Shoe-kake"?

18:15.251 --> 18:16.217
Wh-What's that?

18:16.251 --> 18:17.552
It's 50 guys,
one foot.

18:17.586 --> 18:19.055
Oh, my.

18:19.089 --> 18:21.086
♪ ♪

18:24.055 --> 18:25.191
All right, come
on, Stewie.

18:25.225 --> 18:26.225
Let's get
this over with.

18:26.226 --> 18:27.393
Well, slow down, Brian.

18:27.427 --> 18:28.834
Everyone deserves
a proper burial.

18:28.868 --> 18:30.434
Why do you think
we've been saving

18:30.468 --> 18:32.066
that VCR box
in the basement?

18:32.100 --> 18:33.202
Oh, fine.

18:33.236 --> 18:34.969
Um, Cassandra,

18:35.003 --> 18:37.072
I'm sorry your life
was so screwed up

18:37.106 --> 18:39.669
that you almost had a three-way
with a dog and a baby,

18:39.703 --> 18:41.908
but your life
was not without meaning.

18:41.942 --> 18:44.538
I left the comfort
of the classroom

18:44.572 --> 18:46.609
to experience a world
beyond books,

18:46.644 --> 18:48.641
and thanks to you, I did.

18:48.675 --> 18:51.281
Also, I loaned you $40
for that Lumineers T-shirt,

18:51.315 --> 18:54.115
and you said you'd pay me back,
so I'm gonna take your bra.

18:58.961 --> 19:00.056
Wow.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.698
Lot of people O.D.
at these things.

19:01.732 --> 19:02.930
Yeah.

19:02.964 --> 19:05.436
Let's go trade this bra
for a couple of Gatorades.

19:18.515 --> 19:20.682
All right, you guys,
before we begin,

19:20.716 --> 19:23.449
let's sing the Japanese
national anthem.

19:23.483 --> 19:26.023
Everybody stop
what you're doing!

19:26.057 --> 19:27.583
Yeah, or else we'll...

19:27.625 --> 19:29.319
That one's
wearing goggles.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.622
Mom? Dad?

19:30.656 --> 19:31.989
What are you doing here?

19:32.023 --> 19:33.618
I'll tell you what
we're doing here.

19:33.660 --> 19:35.290
We're protecting
our little girl

19:35.324 --> 19:38.328
from a lot of guys who I oddly
recognize from Best Buy.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.863
Listen, Meg,
your mom and I are sorry

19:40.897 --> 19:42.063
for always
putting you down.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.431
That's right.

19:43.465 --> 19:45.766
You shouldn't have to do porn
to feel appreciated.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.934
Really?

19:46.968 --> 19:48.301
Of course, Meg.

19:48.335 --> 19:49.669
We love you,
sweetheart.

19:49.703 --> 19:51.806
And you deserve
better than this.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.535
Thanks, you guys.

19:56.812 --> 19:58.413
Can we please go home?

19:58.455 --> 20:00.352
Yeah, let's get
out of here.

20:00.394 --> 20:01.722
Not so fast.

20:01.763 --> 20:04.132
I promised these men a foot.

20:08.410 --> 20:09.841
What did you say is going on

20:09.875 --> 20:11.305
on the other side
of this curtain?

20:11.347 --> 20:12.377
Don't worry
about it.

20:12.411 --> 20:13.777
Just keep watching
<i>Tower Heist.</i>

20:13.811 --> 20:15.745
This crew pulling
off a robbery?

20:15.779 --> 20:17.511
Good luck.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.920
Well, Brian,
thanks for going

20:23.954 --> 20:25.234
on that little
adventure with me,

20:25.259 --> 20:26.825
but I think
I've learned quite enough

20:26.860 --> 20:28.290
from the real world
for now.

20:28.332 --> 20:30.627
I guess you're ready for the
purple room after all, huh?

20:30.669 --> 20:33.163
Yes. In fact, today
was my first day.

20:33.205 --> 20:36.497
I saw that teacher at
the concert with her boob out.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.536
She was, um, popular.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.736
Mom, Dad, thanks
for keeping me

20:41.770 --> 20:43.305
from doing something
I'd always regret.

20:43.339 --> 20:44.809
Of course, sweetie.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.010
We love you,
and we would never let

20:47.044 --> 20:48.715
anything bad happen to you.

20:51.717 --> 20:54.055
Peter, we got
a problem.

20:54.055 --> 20:56.731
Somehow my foot got pregnant
watching<i> Tower Heist.</i>
